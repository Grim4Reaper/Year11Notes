title: Market Power
---

### Perfect Competition
- Large numbers of buyers and sellers
- firms are price takes (no market power)
- Homogenous products
- No barriers to entry or exit
- E.g. Agricultural Markets

### Monopoly
- One firm
- No close substitutes for product
- Firms are price setters
- High barriers to entry
- E.g. Utilities

### Oligopoly
- Few large firms
- Goods are close substitutes
- Barriers to entry exist
- Sellers are interdependent:
	- Engage in strategic behaviours
- E.g. Supermarkets, Telecommunications

### Monopolistic Competition
- Many firms
- Differentiated products, but close substitutes
- Low barriers to entry
- Information is imperfect
- Firms are price setters
- E.g. Phones, computes


### Barriers to Entry
#### Economies of Scale
- Permitting lower average costs to be achieved as the firm increases its size
- Average total costs of a large firm are substantially lower the the average costs faced by a smaller firm
- Large firm can charge a lower price

#### Branding
- Creation by a firm of a unique image and image of a product
- Advertising campaigns that try to influence consumer tastes in favour of the product

#### Control of Essential Resources
- Monopolies can arise from ownership or control of an essential resource

#### Aggressive Tactics
- When existing firms use tactics to discourage new firms from entering the market
- Are agreements or arrangements between firms that seek to restrain competition and remove the automatic regulation that competitive markets achieve

##### Illegal Practices
- **Cartel**: When firms agree to act or collude together instead of competing with each other other – includes both price fixing and market sharing
- **Collusion**: General term describing agreements between firms – either price or market sharing – to reduce competition and increase profits
- **Market Sharing**: A market is divided into a series of smaller markets, each supplied by one of the firms, thus reducing competition
- **Collusive Tendering**: Firms agree to submit exorbitant tenders which ensure high profits and the sharing of work between the collusive members
- **Predatory Pricing**: When a company with substantial market power sets is prices at a sufficiently low level with the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor
- **Resale Price Maintenance**: The supplier sets the price at which a retailer must sell its products. The manufacturer may refuse to sell to any retailer which may resell their products at a discount
- **Exclusive Dealing**: When one person trading with another imposes some restrictions on the other’s freedom to choose which whom or where they deal
- **Collective Boycott**: When a group of competitors agree not to acquire goods or services from, or not to supply goods or services to, a business with whom the group is negotiating
- **Merger**: Two or more firms join together to form one larger firm - prohibited if it substantially reduces competition in the market


### Barriers to Entry (Legal)
#### Patents
- Rights given by the government to a firm that has developed a new product or invention to be its sole producer for a specified period of time
- Will have a monopoly during this time

#### Licenses
- Granted by governments for particular professions or industries
- Doesn't lead to monopoly but limits competition

#### Copyrights
- Guarantees that an author has the sole rights to copyrighted work

#### Public Franchises
- Granted to produce particular good or services

#### Tariffs, Quotas and Other Trade Restrictions
- Limits the quantities of a good that can be imported into a country, reducing competition

## Market Power
- A firm has market power if it is able to affect the market price by varying output
- Firms in an imperfect markets have market power as they are able to do so
	- E.g. Monopoly, oligopoly
- Caused by their characteristics and barriers to entry


## Policy Options
### Regulations
- If there is a natural monopoly, it is not in society's interest to break it up into smaller firms, as this would result in higher average costs and would be inefficient
- Governments usually regulate natural monopolies, to ensure more socially desirable price and quantity outcomes
- Governments also control who enters the market

### Deregulations
- Government regulations that restrict competitions include:
	- Limiting the number or types of businesses
	- Limiting the ability of businesses to compete
	- Reduce the incentives for businesses to compete
	- Limiting the choice and information available to consumers
- Some government regulations need to be de-regulated to enhance competition

### Legislation
- Legislation is put in place to limit anti-competitive behaviours to achieve a greater degree of allocative efficiency
- ACCC
	- Aims to protect, strengthen and supplement the way competition works in Australian markets and industries
	- They enforce the competition and consumer act 2010
