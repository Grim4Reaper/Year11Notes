# Deadly Arrows
## Info
This sudoku is still in testing as I need people to test solve it. If you successfully test solve it, please get in contact so I know. I would really appreciate a rough difficulty rating along with any other comments related to the solve path.


## Details
Not uploaded yet, still in testing.


## Rules
- Normal sudoku rules apply.
- Digits within a cage must sum to the number in the top-left corner. Digits must not repeat within a Killer cage.
- Digits along an arrow sum to the digit in the attached circle and may repeat if allowed by other rules.
- Digits along a thermometer increase from the bulb to the tip.
- White dots separate two cells containing consecutive digits.
