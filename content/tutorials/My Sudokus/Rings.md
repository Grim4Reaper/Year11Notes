## Info
This is the first sudoku I ever attempted setting. It is a moderately difficult sudoku that combines [[tutorials/Killer|killer]] and [[tutorials/Arrow|arrow]] (and [[tutorials/Kropki|kropki]]) variants. I tried to make it as geometrically symmetrical and succeeded. The initial break in is difficult but afterwards, it flows nicely.

## Rules
Normal sudoku rules apply.

Digits within a cage must sum to the number in the top-left corner. Digits must not repeat within a Killer cage.

Digits along an arrow sum to the digit in the attached circle and may repeat if allowed by other rules.

White dots separate cells containing consecutive digits.
