# Pipes
## Info
This is an easier puzzle that I set. I initially made the puzzle quite difficult, but was forced weaken it a bit to disambiguate it at the end. It is still a very nice puzzle. It uses the following variants: [[tutorials/Arrow|arrow]], [[tutorials/Killer|killer]], [[tutorials/Palindrome|palindrome]] and [[tutorials/Kropki|kropki]].

## Rules
Normal sudoku rules apply.

Digits along the Palindrome lines (grey lines) read the same forwards and backwards.

Digits within a cage must sum to the number in the top-left corner. Digits must not repeat within a Killer cage.

Digits along an arrow sum to the digit in the attached circle and may repeat if allowed by other rules.

White dots separate two cells containing consecutive digits.
