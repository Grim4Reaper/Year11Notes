# My Sudoku's
This is a collection of all the sudokus I have currently uploaded on [[tutorials/LMD|LMD]]. My username on LMD is MQ9_Reaper2. On this page, I will link the puzzle on LMD, and both the CtC and f-puzzles links. I might also link video features and details on the break-in.

## Rings
This is the first sudoku I have ever attempted to set.
