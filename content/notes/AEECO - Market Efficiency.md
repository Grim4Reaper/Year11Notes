## Surplus
#### Consumer Surplus
> Difference between what a consumer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay in the market.
> 
##### Marginal cost
> The extra opportunity cost of 


#### Producer Surplus
> Difference between what a producer is willing to receive and what they actually receive in a market.

##### Marginal cost
> The extra opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good or service

#### Total Surplus
Total surplus = CS + PS

It is a measure of the net benefits to society from the production consumption of the good.

#### Deadweight Loss
Loss in total surplus that is avoidable.


## Efficiency
> -

### Price Ceiling
> Is the highest price that a producer can charge on a good.

- It is usually below the equilibrium price
- Intended to keep prices affordable for majority of the population

#### Impacts
- Need for rationing process to regulate demand
- Could lead to black markets


### Price Floor
> Is the minimum price that a producer can charge on a good

- It is usually above the equilibrium price
- Designed to ensure that there is a minimum income received by producers

#### Impacts
- Informal illegal markets could result

### Explanation
1. Original price and quantity
2. Implement price floor/ceiling (say above or below equilibrium)
3. New price and quantity
4. Quantity demanded/supplied comparison - Shortage/Surplus
5. Consumer, producer surplus + dead weight loss (use letters, A, B, C, etc)
6. Loss in efficiency

#### Price Ceiling Explanation
The original

## Taxes
### Types of Tax
#### Direct Tax
- E.g. Income tax


#### Indirect Tax
- Consumers do not pay the tax directly, but are affected through changes in the price of the good or service

Specific tax:
- The tax is a fixed amount or is a set sum of money per unit



### Why?
- Can aid in the redistribution of income
- To correct externalities
- To earn revenue

### Impacts
- Reduces quantity while increasing price
- Tax incidence depends on the elasticity of the good/service
- Creates a dead weight loss

### Explanation
1. Original P/Qty
2. Implement gov policy
3. New Price/Quantity
4. Tax revenue
5. CS, PS, TS, DWL
6. Conclusion on efficiency


## Subsidies
> A payment by the government to a firm to reduce production costs and increase output.

- Encourages production of goods with positive externatilies
- Allows the producer to export more
- Aids the expansion of the firm
