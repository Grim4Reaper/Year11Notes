## Section 2 (8 marks)
### Inflation
#### Cause
Inflation has been caused by supply shortages and high consumer demand. This includes the after-affects of covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Consumer demand is high because during the pandemic many people didn't spend as much due to restrictions so when the restrictions lifted, people had more money to spend which led to increased consumer demand. Also, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to grain and energy shortages which has increased the prices of many goods, increasing inflation.



#### Effect
The high inflation in Australia has increased the price of goods and services significantly, which has increased the costs of living. The RBA has increased the cash rate significantly to combat the high inflation, which has increased interest rates. This also means that consumers have lower purchasing power as real wages have fallen.  





### Unemployment
#### Cause
Covid had a severe impact on the Australian economy and labour market, as lockdowns and social distancing measures reduced economic activity and consumer spending. The unemployment rate rose from 5.1% in February 2020 to 7.5% in July 2021. The Australian Government introduced various economic support packages, such as the JobKeeper Payment wage subsidy scheme, to protect the economy and help workers stay connected with their employers. However, some sectors, such as tourism, hospitality, and arts, were more affected than others by the pandemic and experienced higher rates of job losses.




#### Effect
The effects of this unemployment include lower income and living conditions, which reduced aggregate demand and economic growth.
