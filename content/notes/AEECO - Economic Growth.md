# Economic Growth
> [!important] Definition - *Economic Growth*
> An increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services over time
- The increasing capacity of the economy to satisfy the material wants of its society

##### Potential Growth
- The rate of increase in the capacity of the economy to satisfy the needs and wants of people in an economy

##### Actual Growth
- The rate of change in real GDP over a given period of time
  
The target of Australia's GDP is 3-4%.

## PPFs
### Actual Growth PPF
- If an economy is operating inside its PPF and produces more as a result of using preciously unemployed resources, or using resources more efficiently - referred to as **actual growth**
- This is illustrated by a movement from a point within the PPF to a point towards or on the PPF

### Potential Growth PPF
- The productive potential of an economy may be increased by an increase in the quality and/or quantity of resources - known as **potential growth**
- This is illustrated by an outward shift of the PPF

## Measuring Economic Growth
> [!important] Definition - *GDP*
> The total market value of all **final** goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period

#### Calculation
$$\frac{GDP_{yr2}\space - GDP_{yr1}}{GDP_{yr1}}*100$$
**NB: Years can be replaced with quarters**

### Refining GDP
**Nominal GDP:**
- The value of output expressed in the prices of the day
**Real GDP:**
- The value of GDP after taking into account the value of inflation
- Real GDP (%) = Nominal GDP (%) - Inflation rate (%)

**Real GDP per capita:**
- Average real GDP per person in the population

### Limitations of GDP
- Doesn't describe income distribution
- Coincident Indicator
- Non-market production
- Ignores externalities
- Doesn't detail whether the growth is sustainable
- Does not describe non-material welfare

## Determinants of Economic Growth
Growth can come from:
- Potential Growth:
	- Those that increase the capacity of the economy to produce more goods and services with available resources (supply side)
- Actual Growth:
	- How much expenditure is taking place to consume those goods and services (demand side)


### Potential Growth
#### Population Growth
- Increase the total size of the economy: greater demand for G+S and productive factors
- Increase in size of labour force: migration and natural increase
- Migration has more growth than natural: migration promotes transfer of wealth, knowledge and skills and positive fiscal impact

#### Labour Force Participation
- Proportion of people over 15 years old who are in paid work or actively looking for work
- Higher involvement at work: increases the capacity of production (overcomes the effects of an aging workforce)
- Sustains government tax revenue

#### Rising Labour Productivity
- Is the amount of output produced per hour worked

##### Capital deepening
- Increase in the stock of capital relative to the stock of other productive resources
- Production becomes more capital intensive: increasing labour productivity
- Technology changes and improvements of function which help to increase the amount of output

##### Multi-Factor Productivity
- All other factors that improve a worker's ability to produce goods and services (not capita)
- Knowledge and skills that workers develop through education and experience

### Actual Growth
- Factors that affect spending in the economy:
	- Consumption
	- Investment
	- Government expenditure
	- Net exports

## Cost/Benefits
### Benefits of Economic Growth
**Increased material standard of living**
- Increased quantity of goods and services
- Satisfy more wants and needs

**Increased Level of *REAL INCOME***
- How much money an individual or entity makes after accounting for inflation

**Reduced Unemployment**
- Growth stimulates demand for labour, which means more people will be employed and less unemployment

**Improved Efficiency**
- Promote knowledge, skills, productivity and tech changes

**Fiscal Dividend**
- Rising income will lead to higher taxation revenue which can be used for public and merit goods such as infrastructure, health, etc
- Public and merit goods generate considerable external benefits
	- More hospitals and schools mean a healthier and better-educated population

### Costs of Economic Growth
**Structural Unemployment**
- From structural change:
	- When people want new type of G+S and when inventions make it possible?

**Inflationary Pressure**
- When resources are fully employed and the economy is working near its capacity
- High inflation

**Environmental Degradation**
- As production and consumption increase, negative externalities (pollution, etc) are likely to arise

**Social Dislocation**
- High rates of growth may lead to crimes, stress related diseases, suicide, etc

**Income Inequality**
- May not raise standards of living of everyone in the economy at the same rate
