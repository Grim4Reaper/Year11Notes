# Market Power

## Imperfect Markets

> [!IMPORTANT] Imperfect Markets
> Imperfect markets are not in the course outline


The model of demand and supply applies to a competitive market.
- This is characterised by a large number of small firms, free entry and exit and very little product differentiation.
- When one or more of these conditions are not met, the the market is 'imperfect'

### Imperfect markets exists when:
- Relatively small number of firms
- Firms have market power
- Firms use product differentiation
- barriers to entry are used to restrict competition

### Examples
- Monopoly
	- Is a market with just one firm
	- E.g. Synergy, Australia Post
- Oligopoly
	- Is a market with a few large dominant firms
	- E.g. Coles and Woolworths dominate the grocery market in Australia

In an imperfect market, firms are said to have market or 'monopoly' power which means that they can set the price.

Higher prices in imperfect markets due to less competition.

### Barriers to Enter
- Are an important feature of imperfect markets

> [!DEFINITION] Barrier to Enter
> A barrier to entry is anything that restricts or blocks the entry of new firms into an industry or market.
> They may include government regulation, and patents, technology barriers, start-up costs and licensing requirements.

#### Examples
Controlling a scarce resource
- If a mining company pegged the only diamond mine in the country, it would have sole rights to mine the gems

A Government licence granting a legal monopoly
- E.g. Australia Post

A technological advantage
- E.g. Microsoft has considerable market power because it supplies the operating system used in most computers

A patent on an invention gives protection from competition
- Up to 17 years in Australia


#### Imperfect Market Exploitation
- Imperfect markets $\rightarrow$ Firms use market power to 'exploit' the market.
- A firm has market power if it can affect the market price by varying its output.
- Firms with market power will try to maximise profit.
- Private interest $\rightarrow$ not necessarily align with society


### Anti-Competitive Behaviour
- Firms with market power $\rightarrow$ incentive to reduce competition
	- Either reducing price competition or by reducing the number of firms competing in the market


> [!DEFINITION] Anti-Competitive Behaviour
> Refers to any agreements or arrangements between firms that seek to restrain competition and thereby remove the automatic regulation that competitive markets achieve
