# Market Power

The model of demand and supply applies to a competitive market.
- This is characterised by a large number of small firms, free entry and exit and very little product differentiation.
- When one or more of these conditions are not met, the the market is 'imperfect'

Imperfect markets exists when:
- Relatively small number of firms
- Firms have market power
- Firms use product differentiation
- barriers to entry are used to restrict competition
