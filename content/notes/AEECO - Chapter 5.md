# Market Power

## Imperfect Markets
The model of demand and supply applies to a competitive market.
- This is characterised by a large number of small firms, free entry and exit and very little product differentiation.
- When one or more of these conditions are not met, the the market is 'imperfect'

### Imperfect markets exists when:
- Relatively small number of firms
- Firms have market power
- Firms use product differentiation
- barriers to entry are used to restrict competition

### Examples
- Monopoly
	- Is a market with just one firm
	- E.g. Synergy, Australia Post
- Oligopoly
	- Is a market with a few large dominant firms
	- E.g. Coles and Woolworths dominate the grocery market in Australia

In an imperfect market, firms are said to have market or 'monopoly' power which means that they can set the price.

Higher prices in imperfect markets due to less competition.

### Barriers to Enter
