# Price Elasticity of demand
- Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price
- Price elasticity of demand (Ed) can be calculated by Percentage Change
- $$Ed = \frac{\% change \space in \space quantity \space demanded}{\%  \space change \space in \space price}$$


### Price Elastic Goods
The quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price.
- Percentage change in quantity demanded > Percentage change in price
- $|Ed| > 1$

### Price Inelastic Goods
The quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price
- 

#### Special Situations
**Perfectly elastic**
- $Ed = \infty$ 
	- So if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero

**Perfectly inelastic**
- $Ed = 0$
	- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price

**Unitary elastic**
- $Ed = 1$
	- Changes in price equals the change in demand


### Measuring Elasticity
#### Midpoint Method
$$Ed = |\frac{(Q_{2} - Q_1)/[(Q_2 + Q_1)/2]}{(P_{2} - P_{1})/[(P_{2 +}P_1)/2]}|$$
$Ed = |\frac{\Delta Q}{Q_{Avg}} * \frac{P_{Avg}}{\Delta P}|$

#### Point Method
$Ed = |\frac{\Delta Q}{Q_{}} * \frac{P_{}}{\Delta P}|$



### Revenue
TR = P * Q
| Elasticity | Price      | Revenue      |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Elastic    | $\uparrow$ | $\downarrow$ |
| Inelastic  | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ |

Total revenue = Price * Quantity
- Effect of changes in price on total revenue is dependent on the price elasticity of the product

When price decreases
- Price elastic product: Total revenue would increase
- Price inelastic product: Total revenue would decrease
- Unit elastic: No change in total revenue

### Tax
Depending on the elasticity, tax revenue and the burden of the tax would vary.
Tax incidence/burden of the tax: Who bears the majority of the tax
- If a good is price inelastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is higher and the burden of the tax falls more on the consumers
- If a good is price elastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is lower and the burden of the tax falls more on the producers


#### Elastic
**Tax** $= P_{2} - P_3$
**Tax revenue** $= Q_2(P_{2} - P_{1})$

Producer burden > Consumer burden

#### Inelastic
**Tax** $= P_{2} - P_3$
**Tax revenue** $= Q_2(P_{2} - P_{1})$

Consumer burden ($P_{2} - P_{1}$) > Producer burden ($P_{1} - P_{3}$)

##### Example Explanation (Inelastic)
Original price point stuff.
Indirect tax will shift the supply curve to the left, the amount of tax. The tax increases price to $P_2$, and increases the price consumers now pay. Producers are now receiving $P_3$. Quantity has fallen to $Q_2$. The tax revenue is $Q_2(P_{2} - P_{3})$. The consumers bears a higher burden of the tax compared to the producers. 


### Factors Affecting PED
#### The availability of substitutes
- If there are lots of substitutes - more elastic
- If there are no substitutes - less elastic (Inelastic)

#### Whether the good is a necessity or a luxury
- If a good is a necessity - Inelastic
- If a good is a luxury - Elastic

#### Proportion of income spent
- The greater proportion of income, the more elastic
- Cheaper goods are less elastic than expensive goods

#### Time period considered
- The longer consumers to have to respond to changes, the more elastic
- As time goes on, goods become more elastic

#### The definition of the market
- Narrower the market, the more responsive (Elastic)


# Price Elasticity of Supply
> Measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price

$$Es = \frac{\% \space change \space in \space quantity \space supplied}{\% \space change \space in \space price}$$


| Elasticity          | Elasticity Co-efficient | Interpretation                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Price Elastic       | E > 1                   | Change in supply is greater than change in price. |
| Price Inelastic     | E < 1                   | Change in supply is less than change in price     |
| Unitary             | E = 1                   | Change in supply is equal to the change in price  |
| Perfectly Inelastic | E = 0                   | Change in price results in no supply              |
| Perfectly Elastic   | E = $\infty$            | Change in price results in no change in supply    |


### Factors Affecting PES
#### Time
- In the short term, goods are going to be unresponsive (Inelastic)
- After some time, people are able to react to the price changes (Elastic)

#### Nature of the Industry
- If you can easily change products (pencils), it is elastic
- If you can't easily change products (agriculture), it is inelastic

#### Ability to Store Inventories
- If a business is easily store inventories (canned food), they can respond quicker (Elastic)
- If a business is
