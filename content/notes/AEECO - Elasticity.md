## Price Elasticity of demand
- Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price
- Price elasticity of demand (Ed) can be calculated by Percentage Change
- Ed = \frac{% change in quantity demanded}{% percentage change in price}

### Price Elastic Goods
The quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price.
- Percentage change in quantity demanded > Percentage change in price
- $|Ed| > 1$

### Price Inelastic Goods
The quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price
- 

#### Special Situations
**Perfectly elastic**
- $Ed = \infty$ 
	- So if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero

**Perfectly inelastic**
- $Ed = 0$
	- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price
