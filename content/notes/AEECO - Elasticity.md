## Price Elasticity of demand
- Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price
- Price elasticity of demand (Ed) can be calculated by Percentage Change
- Ed = \frac{% change in quantity demanded}{% percentage change in price}

### Price Elastic Goods
The quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price.
- Percentage change in quantity demanded > Percentage change in price
- $|Ed| > 1$

### Price Inelastic Goods
The quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price
- 

#### Special Situations
**Perfectly elastic**
- $Ed = \infty$ 
	- So if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero

**Perfectly inelastic**
- $Ed = 0$
	- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price

**Unitary elastic**
- $Ed = 1$
	- Changes in price equals the change in demand


### Measuring Elasticity
#### Midpoint Method
$$Ed = |\frac{(Q_{2} - Q_1)/[(Q_2 + Q_1)/2]}{(P_{2} - P_{1})/[(P_{2 +}P_1)/2]}|$$
$Ed = |\frac{\Delta Q}{Q_{Avg}} * \frac{P_{Avg}}{\Delta P}|$

#### Point Method
$Ed = |\frac{\Delta Q}{Q_{}} * \frac{P_{}}{\Delta P}|$



### Revenue
TR = P * Q
| Elasticity | Price      | Revenue      |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Elastic    | $\uparrow$ | $\downarrow$ |
| Inelastic  | $\uparrow$ | $\uparrow$ |

Total revenue = Price * Quantity
- Effect of changes in price on total revenue is dependent on the price elasticity of the product

When price decreases
- Price elastic product: Total revenue would increase
- Price inelastic product: Total revenue would decrease
- Unit elastic: No change in total revenue

### Tax
Depending on the elasticity, tax revenue and the burden of the tax would vary.
Tax incidence/burden of the tax: Who bears the majority of the tax
- If a good is price inelastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is higher and the burden of the tax falls more on the consumers
- If a good is price elastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is lower and the burden of the tax falls more on the producers


#### Elastic
**Tax** $= P_{2} - P_3$
**Tax revenue** $= Q_2(P_{2} - P_{1})$

Producer burden > Consumer burden

#### Inelastic
**Tax** $= P_{2} - P_3$
**Tax revenue** $= Q_2(P_{2} - P_{1})$

Consumer burden ($P_{2} - P_{1}$) > Producer burden ($P_{1} - P_{3}$)

##### Example Explanation (Inelastic)
Original price point stuff.
Indirect tax will shift the supply curve to the left, the amount of tax. The tax increases price to $P_2$, and increases the price consumers now pay. Producers are now receiving $P_3$. Quantity has fallen to $Q_2$. The tax revenue is $Q_2(P_{2} - P_{3})$. The consumers bears a higher burden of the tax compared to the producers. 


### Factors Affecting PED
#### The availability of Substitutes


#### Whether the good is a necessity or a luxury
