# Notes
## Part A
### Negative Production Externalities
- The release of large amounts of CO$_2$ which contribute substantially to climate change in a number of ways. Climate change has quite a few costs that are paid by people in general.
- More respiratory illnesses leading to higher medical costs to the state from the pollutants (as opposed to the CO$_2$ release which doesn't tend to directly cause these problems)
- Increased acid rain and its effects on water systems (due to pollutants).
- The release of mercury and its effect on wildlife (both bioaccumulation and biomagnification).
- Or a number of other negative results.
- Air pollution from burning fossil fuels. This activity causes damages to crops, materials and (historic) buildings and public health.
- Anthropogenic climate change as a consequence of greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels



#### Health Risks
- The extraction of oil has many adverse health affects on workers and nearby residents
- Increased risk of:
	- Many types of cancer
	- Cardiovascular problems
	- Neurologic and hematological problems

#### Environmental Damage
##### Oil Spills
- Fishing opportunities for thousands of fisherfolk lost due to mangrove contamination
- Reduced marine productivity due to disruption of the food chain
- Opportunity cost due to government dispatch of ships and aircraft to conduct clean-up operations
- Loss of marine and coastal wildlife (e.g. fish, birds, turtles, sea snakes, mammals)
- Loss of tourism revenue (affects surfers, beach goers, sports fishing, SCUBA diving)
- Loss of ecological function of marshlands and mud flats
- Lost income for tourism industries
- Decline in aquaculture production (e.g. seaweed farms, fish cages, shellfish beds)
- Oil price hike due to lost oil production
- Health costs for those engaged in clean-up operations

##### Extraction
