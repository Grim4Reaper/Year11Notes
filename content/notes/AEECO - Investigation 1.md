# Notes
## Part A
### Externalities



#### Negative Externalities
- The release of large amounts of CO2 which contribute substantially to climate change in a number of ways. Climate change has quite a few costs that are paid by people in general.
- More respiratory illnesses leading to higher medical costs to the state from the pollutants (as opposed to the CO2 release which doesn't tend to directly cause these problems)
- Increased acid rain and its effects on water systems (due to pollutants).
- The release of mercury and its effect on wildlife (both bioaccumulation and biomagnification).
- Or a number of other negative results.


**Environmental Damage**  
There is environment damage associated with the oil and gas industry





## Part B
### Regulation/Legislation
