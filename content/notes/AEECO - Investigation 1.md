## Part A
### Externalities
Externalities are costs or benefits that are not reflected in the market price of goods or services. In the case of oil and gas markets, externalities can include environmental damage caused by extraction and transportation of oil and gas, as well as health impacts from pollution [3](https://www.statista.com/topics/5608/oil-and-gas-industry-in-australia/). The Australian government has implemented policies to address these externalities such as carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes.
