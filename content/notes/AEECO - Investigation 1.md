### Externalities



Externalities are costs or benefits that are not reflected in the market price of goods or services. [In the case of oil and gas markets, externalities can include environmental damage caused by extraction and transportation of oil and gas, as well as health impacts from pollution](https://www.statista.com/topics/5608/oil-and-gas-industry-in-australia/)[3](https://www.statista.com/topics/5608/oil-and-gas-industry-in-australia/). [The Australian government has implemented policies to address these externalities such as carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes](https://www.statista.com/topics/5608/oil-and-gas-industry-in-australia/)[3](https://www.statista.com/topics/5608/oil-and-gas-industry-in-australia/).
