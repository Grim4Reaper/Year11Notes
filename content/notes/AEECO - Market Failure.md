# Causes of Market Failure
### Classification of Goods
#### Rival
- Does the consumption by one party reduce the supply available for another?
#### Excludable
- Is it possible to exclude a non-payer from the good or service

### Private Goods
**Rival**
- Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
**Excludable**
- There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service

### Club Goods
**Non-Rival**
- Your consumption of the good or service does not prevent another party from consuming it
**Excludable**
- There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service

### Common Property Resources
**Rival**
- Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
**Non-Excludable**
- There are no requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service

### Public Goods
**Non-Rival**

## Market Failure

### Tragedy of the Commons - Common Property Resources
- Refers to the over-consumption of common property resources
- Occurs as the resource is readily available and there are no restrictions on consumption
- However, once consumed the resource is not available to any other party.


### Free Rider Effect - Public Goods
- Free riders enjoy the benefits of the consumption of a resource without paying for the cost of provision
- This can lead to over-consumption and rapid damage of a public resource

### Policy Options to Address the Market Failure
#### Common Property Goods
- Enforce restrictions on consumption - eg fishing limits
#### Public Goods
- Create ownership of the resource - eg fines, fees

## Merit Goods and Demerit Goods
**Merit goods**
- Goods that are produced that have large external benefits for society
- Goods that will be underprovided in the economy if the product is left in the market

**Demerit goods**
- Goods that are produced that have large external costs for society
- Goods that will be overprovided if left in the market
- Are private goods as they are both rivalry and exclusive
