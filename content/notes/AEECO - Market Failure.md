# Causes of Market Failure
### Classification of Goods
#### Rival
- Does the consumption by one party reduce the supply available for another?
#### Excludable
- Is it possible to exclude a non-payer from the good or service

### Private Goods
**Rival**
- Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
**Excludable**
- There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service

### Club Goods
**Non-Rival**
- Your consumption of the good or service does not prevent another party from consuming it
**Excludable**
- There are requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service

### Common Property Resources
**Rival**
- Your consumption of the good or service means another party cannot consume it
**Non-Excludable**
- There are no requirements to be met before being able to access the good or service


## Tragedy of the Commons
- Refers to the over-consumption of common property resources
- Occurs as the resource is readily available and there are no restrictions on consumption
- However, once consumed the resource is not available to any other par
