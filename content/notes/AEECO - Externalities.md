# Externalities

### Key Concepts
Demand: Private benefits that consumers receive 
Supply: Private costs of production 
MPC (Marginal Private Cost): Costs to producers of producing one more unit of a good 
MSC (Marginal Social Cost): Costs to society of producing one more unit of a good 
MPB (Marginal Private Benefit): Benefits to consumers from consuming one more unit of a good 
MSB (Marginal Social Benefit): Benefits to society from consuming one more unit of a good 

When MPC=MSC and MPB=MSB socially optimal


> [!DEFINITION] Externalities
> Externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good/service cause external costs and/or external benefits.

- It is the side effects of economic activity; or
- Unintended consequences of economic activity
- Externalities cause market failure if the price mechanism does not take into account the social costs and benefits of production and consumption

## Negative Externalities
- Occurs when production and/or consumption creates an external cost
- Causes overconsumption/production
	- Market quantity is greater than optimal quantity
	- Market price is less than optimal price
- Results in deadweight loss

### Types of Negative Externalities
#### Negative Production Externality
- Where the marginal social cost of production is higher than the marginal private cost
- Examples:
	- Air pollution
	- Land pollution
	- Noise pollution


#### Negative Consumption Externality
- Where the marginal social benefit of consumption is lower the the marginal private benefit
- Examples:
	- Smoking
	- Alcohol

## Positive Externalities
- External benefits of consumption or production for third parties
- Causes under consumption or production
- Results in deadweight loss

### Types of Positive Externalities
#### Positive Consumptions Externality
- Where the marginal social benefit of consumption is higher than the marginal private benefit
- Examples:
	- Flu vaccines
	- Education

#### Positive Production Externality
- Where the marginal social cost of production is lower than the marginal private cost
- Example:
	- Lower transport costs for local firms following construction of new roads


# Policy Options
## Regulation/Legislation
### Negative Production Externality
#### Government Regulation
##### XYZ
###### ABC
####### 
Regulations can forbid the dumping of pollutants to the environment  

1. Limit the amount of pollutions
2. Limit the quantity of output to producers
3. Require technologies to reduce emissions
