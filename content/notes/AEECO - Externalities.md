# Externalities

### Key Concepts
Demand: Private benefits that consumers receive  
Supply: Private costs of production  
MPC (Marginal Private Cost): Costs to producers of producing one more unit of a good  
MSC (Marginal Social Cost): Costs to society of producing one more unit of a good  
MPB (Marginal Private Benefit): Benefits to consumers from consuming one more unit of a good  
MSB (Marginal Social Benefit): Benefits to society from consuming one more unit of a good  

When MPC=MSC and MPB=MSB socially optimal  

MPC = Production cost  
MPB = Revenue  
MEC = Pollution, etc, INCLUDE TYPE OF POLLUTION  
MSC = MPC + MEC  
		= Total for society  


> [!DEFINITION] Externalities
> Externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good/service cause external costs and/or external benefits.

- It is the side effects of economic activity; or
- Unintended consequences of economic activity
- Externalities cause market failure if the price mechanism does not take into account the social costs and benefits of production and consumption

## Negative Externalities
- Occurs when production and/or consumption creates an external cost
- Causes overconsumption/production
	- Market quantity is greater than optimal quantity
	- Market price is less than optimal price
- Results in deadweight loss

### Types of Negative Externalities
#### Negative Production Externality
- Where the marginal social cost of production is higher than the marginal private cost
- Examples:
	- Air pollution
	- Land pollution
	- Noise pollution


#### Negative Consumption Externality
- Where the marginal social benefit of consumption is lower the the marginal private benefit
- Examples:
	- Smoking
	- Alcohol

## Positive Externalities
- External benefits of consumption or production for third parties
- Causes under consumption or production
- Results in deadweight loss

### Types of Positive Externalities
#### Positive Consumptions Externality
- Where the marginal social benefit of consumption is higher than the marginal private benefit
- Examples:
	- Flu vaccines
	- Education

#### Positive Production Externality
- Where the marginal social cost of production is lower than the marginal private cost
- Example:
	- Lower transport costs for local firms following construction of new roads


# Policy Options
## Negative Production Externality
### Government Regulation
Regulations can forbid the dumping of pollutants to the environment  

1. Limit the amount of pollutions
2. Limit the quantity of output to producers
3. Require technologies to reduce emissions

### Taxes
Imposing a tax on per unit of production or pollutant emission.  
Internalise the external cost.  

## Negative Consumption Externalities
### Government Regulations
- Prevents consumer activities
- Reduce demand towards MSB
- Quantity lowered to $Q_o$ and price lowered to $P_o$

### Advertising
- Prevents consumer activities
- Reduce demand towards MSB
- Quantity lowered to $Q_o$ and price lowered to $P_o$


### Taxes
- Impose indirect tax the size of the external cost
- The impact of the tax is passed onto the consumers as a higher price they now have to burden
- Quantity drops to $Q_o$ and price increases to $P_c$


## Positive Production Externalities
### Government Regulations
- Direct government provision:
	- Coming out of government funds
- MPC shifts towards MSC
- Quantity increases to $Q_o$ and price decreases to $P_o$


### Subsidies
- Government can provide subsides the size of the external benefit (internalize)
- MSC=MPC + subsidy
-  Quantity increases to $Q_o$ and price decreases to $P_o$


## Positive Consumption Externalities
### Legislation/Advertising
- Legislation:
	- Used to increase consumption
	- E.g Putting compulsory ages to education
- A
