# Business Trade Cycle
- Fluctuations in the growth of real output, consisting of alternating periods of expansion and contraction are called business cycles or economic Fluctuations
- A business cycle plots real GDP on the vertical axis, against time on the horizontal axis

## Phases
### Expansion
- An expansion occurs when there is positive growth in real GDP
- During periods of real GDP growth, employment of resources increases, and the general price level of the economy usually begins to rise more rapidly (inflation)
- Consumer and business confidence increases
- Real wage increase - Higher demand for labour
- Decrease of business inventory

### Peak
- A peak represents the cycle's maximum real GDP
- When the ecconomy reaches a peak, unemployment of resources has fallen substantially, and the general price level may be rising rapidly
- The economy is likely to be experiencing inflation
- Increase in real wages
- Very high consumer/business confidence
- High aggregate expenditure

### Contraction
- Following the peak, the economy begins to experience falling real GDP
- If the contraction lasts six months or more, it is a recession
- Increases in the price level may slow down a bit 

### Trough
- A trough represents the cycle's minimum level of GDP
- There may now be widespread unemployment
- A trough is followed by a new period of expansion

## BTC
- Economic growth over long periods of time is highly desirable
- Growth in real output provides opportunities to achieve higher incomes and higher standards of living
- During expansions, the economy usually experiences high inflation, which is not good for the economy
- During contractions, the economy usually experiences high levels of unemployment
- Reducing the intensity of expansions and contractions would lesson the problems


# Indicators

## Lagging Indicators
