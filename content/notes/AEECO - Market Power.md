title: Market Power
---

### Perfect Competition
- Large numbers of buyers and sellers
- firms are price takes (no market power)
- Homogenous products
- No barriers to entry or exit
- E.g. Agricultural Markets

### Monopoly
- One firm
- No close substitutes for product
- Firms are price setters
- High barriers to entry
- E.g. Utilities

### Oligopoly
- Few large firms
- Goods are close substitutes
- Barriers to entry exist
- Sellers are interdependent:
	- Engage in strategic behaviours
- E.g. Supermarkets, Telecommunications
