title: Market Power
---

### Perfect Competition
- Large numbers of buyers and sellers
- firms are price takes (no market power)
- Homogenous products
- No barriers to entry or exit
- E.g. Agricultural Markets

### Monopoly
- One firm
- No close substitutes for product
- Firms are price setters
- High barriers to entry
- E.g. Utilities

### Oligopoly
- Few large firms
- Goods are close substitutes
- Barriers to entry exist
- Sellers are interdependent:
	- Engage in strategic behaviours
- E.g. Supermarkets, Telecommunications

### Monopolistic Competition
- Many firms
- Differentiated products, but close substitutes
- Low barriers to entry
- Information is imperfect
- Firms are price setters
- E.g. Phones, computes


### Barriers to Entry
#### Economies of Scale
- Permitting lower average costs to be achieved as the firm increases its size
  
- Average total costs of a large firm are substantially lower the the average costs faced by a smaller firm
- Large firm can charge a lower price

#### Branding
- Creation by a firm of a unique image and image of a product
  
- Advertising campaigns that try to influence consumer tastes in favour of the product
