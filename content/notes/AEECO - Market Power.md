title: Market Power
---

### Perfect Competition
- Large numbers of buyers and sellers
- firms are price takes (no market power)
- Homogenous products
- No barriers to entry or exit
- E.g. Agricultural Markets

### Monopoly
- One firm
- No close substitutes for product
- Firms are price setters
- High barriers to entry
- E.g. Utilities
