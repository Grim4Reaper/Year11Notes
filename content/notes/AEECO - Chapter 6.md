# Macroeconomic Activity
## Circular Flow of Income
- It is a macroeconomic model that describes the flows of resources, goods and services, and income and expenditure, between the parts of the economy.
- It divides the economy into its key sectors:
	- Households
	- Firms
	- The Financial Sector
	- The Government
	- The Overseas Sector

### Households and Firms
- Basic model
- Simplifies assumptions
	- Only two sectors in the economy - households and firms
	- Households are the owners of the productive resources (land, labour, capital and enterprise); and the buyers of final goods and services
	- Firms are the employers of resources, and produce all the goods and services for the economy
	- Households spend all their income, so there is no saving
	- There is no government sector
	- There is no overseas trade
- 
  
### Saving and Investment
- Relax assumption that households spend all their income with no saving
- The financial markets such as banks, credit unions and super funds make up the **capital/finance** market
	- Saving represents a leakage from the model
	- Investment is defined as a expenditure of firms on production equipment and machinery

### The Government Sector
- Produces goods and services such as healthcare, education, welfare services and defence
	- This is by purchasing products in the factor market; this is why gov. spending is an injection into firms
	- Things such as welfare allowances are called **transfer payments** because they are provided without exchange of goods and services in return

### Overseas Sector
- All households spend some of their income on goods and services imported from overseas.
	- We relax the assumption that the economy is closed as we export and import through leakages and injections

#### Equilibrium
- 'One man's spending is another mans income'.
- $\Sigma O = \Sigma Y = \Sigma E$
	- (output, income and expenditure respectively)
	- This is known as equilibrium
- When these requirements are not met (what usually occurs in the real world), disequilibrium is achieved
