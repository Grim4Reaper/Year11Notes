# Intro to Macroeconomics

## Circular Flow of Income
> [!important] Definition
> A Macroeconomic model that describes the flows of resources, goods and service, income and expenditure between different parts of the economy.
  
### Includes
- Firms
- Households
- Government
- Financial Sector
- Overseas

### Households and Firms
#### Assumptions
- Households own all the resources and are buyers
- Firms are employers and produce goods and services
- Factor market
- Product market
- The two markets are interdepended 

### Injections and Leakages
#### Injections
> [!important] Definition
> Inflow of money into the circular flow of income
- Investment (I)
- Government Expenditure (G)
- Exports (X)

#### Leakages

> [!important] Definition
> Outflow of money from the circular flow of income
- Savings (S)
- Taxation (T)
- Imports (M)

### Equilibrium
- An economy is in equilibrium when the sum of all leakages = the sum of all injections
- Occurs when S+T+M = I+G+X
- Sum of all output (O) = Sum of all Expenditure (E) = Sum of all income (Y)
	- All the income from households equals the expenditure on goods and services which equals the total production in the economy

#### Changes to Equilibrium
##### S>I
- Flow of Y must contract
- Total spending is less than output
- Inventories increases due to less expenditure
- Firms decrease production
- Households receives less income TBF


## Aggregate Expenditure

### Measuring Economic Performance
#### GDP
- **Expenditure approach**
	- Addition of all final expenditures within a country given a period of time
- National income approach
	- Addition of al income earned from factors of production that produce goods and services given a period of time
- Output approach
	- Addition of all value of goods and services produced in a country given a period of time

### Aggregate Expenditure
> [!important] Definition
> Total amount that firms, households and government plan to spend on final goods and services at each level of income
- Calculated as AE = C + I + G + (X-M)

#### Consumption
##### Components
Households expenditure goods and services:
- Durables: >3 years
- Non-durables: <3 years
- Services
- Something else

##### Factors Affecting Consumption
- Disposable income: More income = more spending
- Interest rates: High interest rates = more saving
- Availability of credit: More loans = more spending
- Stock of personal wealth: More wealth = more spending
- Expectations: Expecting economy downturn = more saving
- Government policies: Higher tax = less spending


#### Private Investment
> [!important] Definition
> Expenditure on producer or capital goods that are used to produce final goods and services in the future

##### Investment by private firms
- Fixed investment (usually on capital goods)
- Residential fixed investment (private expenditure on new housing)
- Changes in business inventories (stocks of goods that have been produced but not sold)

##### Factors Affecting Investment Expenditure
- Rate of interest (nominal vs real rates): Higher interest rates = less spending
- Business expectations
- Level of past profits (profitability)
- Government policies

#### Government Expenditure
- All federal, state, local government expenditure
- 2 parts:
	- **G1**: Current government expenditure on day to day functions
	- **G2**: Government expenditure used for future needs

##### Factors Affecting Government Expenditure
- Government policy objectives
- Current economic climate

#### Net Exports
- Value of exports minus value of imports

##### Factors Affecting Net Exports
- Exchange rates: $AUD increases = Imports decreases and exports increase
- Domestic and overseas economic activity: Aus doing well = Imports increase, overseas doing well = Exports increase
- Tariffs/Quotas: Higher tariffs = decrease
