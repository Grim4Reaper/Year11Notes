### Term 2
#### W1L1
Did some very basic questions on sets. I had lots of great entertainment in the form of Edward trying to get an email client on Linux for the entire period. He keeps installing then deleting wine to get Windows on Linux on a Windows computer. Just why?!?!

#### W1L2
Did some basic function stuff. I was bored because Ed had a rehearsal or something.

#### W1L3
Ed was back. YAY! Did
