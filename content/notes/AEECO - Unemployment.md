# Unemployment

> [!important] Definition
> Is the proportion of labour force who are ==willing and able== to work but cannot find a job


## Definitions
Working age population:
- Part of the population that is of working age (>15)
Labour force:
- The portion of the working age population who are either working, or are actively seeking work
Participation rate:
- Proportion of the working age population who are either working, or are actively seeking work
Underemployment:
- People who wish to work longer hours but can't
Disguised unemployment:
- Underemployment:
	- When people are employed less than they would like to
Hidden unemployed:
- Discouraged workers:
	- Workers who choose not to participate in the labour force because previous efforts to find a job have been frustrated
Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU):
- Unemployment that can not be reduced by expanding aggregate demand (full employment)

## Measurement of Unemployment
Unemployment rate = $\frac{Unemployed}{Labour force}*100$
Labour force participation rate = $\frac{Labour force}{Working\space age\space population}*100$


## Limitations
- Doesn't account for hidden unemployment
- Doesn't account for underemployment
- Excludes people with disabilities


## Types of Unemployment
### Cyclical UE
- Follows the cyclical movements of the business trade cycle
- Derived from the demand of final goods and services
- Can get to 0%

### Structural UE
- When there is a mismatch of available and required skills in a sector of the economy
- Causes:
	- Changes in technology
	- Changes in the demand for productive factors
	- Changes in the pattern of consumer demand
- Can be long term, especially for older workers
- Is always going to exist

### Frictional UE
- Unemployment that occurs due to the job search that occurs when in transition between different jobs
- Is most likely to be short term
- Is always going to exist

## Impact of Unemployment
- Lower levels of AE, investment and business confidence
    - UE indicates that resources are under-utilised
    - There is a gap between actual GDP and potential GDP
- Higher welfare payments
    - Opportunity cost:
         - Potential expenditure on infrastructure, health or education
- Increased social problems
     - E.g. depression, violence, crime

### Distribution of Income
- Affects different groups of people differently
    - Dependent on factors including age, health status and geographical location
- Increases income inequality


## Full Employment
- When the economy is at its maximum production capacity
- Considered to exist when there is zero cyclical unemployment


### Natural Rate of Unemployment
- Structural UE + frictional UE 
- Below 5%?

### NAIRU
- Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment
- Is the lowest unemployment rate that can be sustained without causing wages growth and inflation to rise
- There will be spare capacity in an economy when aggregate demand for goods and services is less than the economy's capacity to produce them
- Indicator of this spare capacity is the difference between the NAIRU and the unemployment rate - aka unemployment rate gap
- If the unemployment rate is higher than the NAIRU, the economy would not be at full employment and there would be downward pressure on inflation
- If the unemployment rate is lower than the NAIRU, the economy is operating above its full capacity, and there is upward pressure on inflation

### Implications of Full Employment
- Economy is nearing or at full capacity
- Can lead to oversupply of labour
- Creates inflationary pressure

### Trade off Between Unemployment and Inflation
- Low unemployment is usually correlated with high inflationary
    - Low unemployment leads to inflationary pressure due to high levels of demand
- High unemployment is usually correlated with low inflation
- Can be represented by the Phillips Curve
