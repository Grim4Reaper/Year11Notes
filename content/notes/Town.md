# The Town

I am part of the town. It is located in the middle of a desert with nothing but sand and dust surrounding us in the harshest environment in the world. I have no idea how the inhabitants of this Town survived this long, but their houses are still intact. Barely.

The town consists of:
- [M.Spicata](https://spicata.github.io/), who owns a multi-story garden filled with fresh plants. He has a variety of things growing in his garden, including a budget comic series.
- [DefinitelyEddie](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/) lives in a quartz house and likes to keep his lights off, even with guests. He has made it very difficult to turn the lights on, and once they are on, you are instantly blinded. He love chemistry because it allows him to create m-[REDACTED]. (If you can't find the house, it will probably be because he has burnt it down again.)
- [MacE](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/) has one of the best computer science libraries in the town. He also has good physics notes. His house is a bit different from everyone else because he built it with his good computer science skills.
- [NotMario](https://notmario.github.io/thenotes/) has the other really good computer science libraries. It lacks detail in other subjects.
- [Anonymous](https://anonymoof1528.github.io/into-the-shadow-garten/) is really good at Japanese which is the main focus of his house. We don't know much about this anonymous person, so enter at your own risk.
- [NotTacoz](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/) lives in/next to a Jacaranda tree. He imported it into the town for his home.
- [Jonathan](https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/) lives in a quartz house that looks a lot like Ed's.
- [Shan-Mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/) loves music and journals what she does in class. She is the youngest resident (year 9) and is allegedly dating Edward. Yes, there is a 2 year age difference, it just works.
