# The Town

I am part of the town. It is located in the middle of a desert with nothing but sand and dust surrounding us in the harshest environment in the world. I have no idea how the inhabitants of this Town survived this long, but their houses are still intact. Barely.

The town consists of:
- [M.Spicata](https://spicata.github.io/), who owns a multi-story garden filled with fresh plants. He has a variety of things growing in his garden, including a budget comic series.
- [DefinitelyEddie](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/) lives in a quartz house and likes to keep his lights off, even with guests. He has made it very difficult to turn the lights on, and once they are on, you are instantly blinded. He love chemistry because it allows him to create me[REDACTED]
