# Welcome to my notes v3
Welcome to my notes. They are very unfinished as I am in the process of moving and uploading them to this new website. 

If something isn't working, raise the issue on the github repository and blame Edward (@EddieTheEd [EddieTheEd](https://github.com/EddieTheEd)). He slanders me on his website, which you should not visit (his website is also a virus). He also unjustly accuses me of defamation. I am not the person who has burnt their house done twice (unlike Edd). These allegations are addressed [[notes/Allegations]]



>Ed is a bit of a delinquent.
