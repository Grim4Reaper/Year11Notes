# Welcome to my notes v3
Welcome to my notes. They are very unfinished as I am in the process of moving and uploading them to this new website. 

If something isn't working, raise the issue on the github repository and blame Edward (@EddieTheEd [EddieTheEd](https://github.com/EddieTheEd)). He slanders me on his website, which you should not visit (his website is also a virus). He also unjustly accuses me of defamation. I am not the person who has burnt their house done twice (unlike Edd). These allegations are addressed [[notes/17-03-2023 Allegations|here]].

The rumours surrounding Ed dating Shan-mei have been confirmed. He is now assaulting me and Widjaja (H.K.Widjaja) for telling the truth. He even went on a date to a concert with her - "allegedly" as Ed says.

Ed is dating [REDACTED].

Journals can be found [[notes/Journaling|Journaling]].
