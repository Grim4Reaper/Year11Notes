# Welcome to my notes v3
Welcome to my notes. They are very unfinished as I am in the process of moving and uploading them to this new website. (NB: This is now a different website that I have moved to.)

If something isn't working, raise the issue on the github repository and blame Edward (@EddieTheEd [EddieTheEd](https://github.com/EddieTheEd)). He slanders me on his website, which you should not visit. He also unjustly accuses me of defamation. I am not the person who has burnt their house done twice (unlike Ed).

I have ~~started~~ stopped a journal of what we do in class each lesson which can be found [[_notes/Journaling|here]].

I am part of the [[_notes/The Town|Town]]

Occasionally I write articles which can be found [[articles/Home|here]].
