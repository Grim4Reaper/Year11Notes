Includes: Animals, plants, fungi, protists.\nProkaryotes are any organisms - usually unicellular - whose DNA is suspended freely in the cytoplasm.\n\n## Bacteria\n\nBacteria can reproduce quickly and compete with host cells for space and nutrition.\nMost are relatively harmless and some may even form mutualistic relationships with hosts.\n\nCan cause disease by:\n- Damaging host tissues which prevents normal function\n- Producing exotoxins while metabolising\n- Releasing endotoxins when destroyed\nAs the toxins retain their destructive capacity beyond bacterial death, they are often the cause of food poisoning.\n\nThe capsule protects bacteria from viruses, or attack from a host organism's immune system.\n\nBacterial cells often contain several plasmids - small continuous loops of DNA.\nPlasmids are replicated independently of a bacterium's genophore.\n\n\n## Viruses\nViruses are non-cellular pathogens, they are not living.\n\nThey are very simple structures compared to cells - made from nucleic acids and a protein coat, know as a capsid.\nThe genetic material can be either DNA or RNA, often have an envelope of membrane around the outside.\n\n![[001a Virus Diagram.png|500]]\n\n![[001b Types of Viruses.png|500]]\n\n![[001c Replication of Viruses.png|500]]\n\n\n\n\n\n## Fungi and Protists\n\nBoth fungi and protists are eukaryotic organisms.\n\nProtists are unicellular eukaryotes that are not plants, animals, or fungi.\nProtists can be unicellular or multicellular.\n\nFungi are not photosynthetic, and their cell walls are usually made out of chitin rather than cellulose. (E.g. Mould and yeast)\n\nMany fungal diseases are external, causing irritation and inflammation of the skin.\nCandidiasis is a fungal infection caused by a yeast called Candida albicans. Candida normally lives on the skin and inside the body.\n\n\nProtists include:\n- Algae\n- Protozoa\n- Slime moulds\n\n\n## Parasitism\nParasitism is a close and permanent association between two organisms in which one benefits and the other is harmed.\n\n### Malaria\nMalaria is a disease caused by a protozoan parasite. It is transmitted by a vector - the Anopheles mosquitos.\nThe symptoms of malaria include shivering, fever, sweating, joint pain, vomiting and anaemia.\n\nThey typically occur cyclically every two to three days.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.53774062Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Biology/002-Diseases":{"title":"Diseases","content":"# Diseases\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\nPathogen: A disease causing agent.\nSigns: What can be seen.\nSymptoms: What the patient feels.\n\nDiseases can be classed in several ways:\n- Infectious vs non-infectious\n- Contagious vs non-contagious\n- Inherited vs non-inherited\n- Acute (quickly and short) vs chronic (slowly and long)\n- Single factor (single cause) vs multifactorial (many causes)\n\nMany non-infectious diseases develop as a result of the interaction between a person's environment or lifestyle and their genes.\n\nA risk factor is anything that increases the chance of developing a disease.\n\nRisk factors are correlational with a disease, not necessarily causal.\n\nAn infectious disease is a disease resulting from infection of a host organism by a pathogen.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n| Term | Definition |\n| --- | --- |\n| Disease |A disease is a disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.|\n| Disorder ||\n| Micro-organism |A micro-organism is an organism that can only be seen under a microscope.|\n| Pathogen |A pathogen is a micro-organism that can cause disease.|\n| Pathology ||\n| Host ||\n| Parasite ||\n| Infection ||\n| Contagious ||\n| Communicable ||\n| Virulence ||\n| Endemic ||\n| Epidemic ||\n| Pandemic ||\n| Outbreak ||\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.53774062Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Biology/003-Immunology":{"title":"Immunology","content":"# Immunology\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\nThe immune system is a group of cells, tissues, organs and mechanisms that defend against pathogens and other foreign substances.\n\nAn immune response is a complex series of specific and non-specific processes involving a range of cells and chemicals.\n\n**Methods of disease transmission**\n| Direct | Indirect | Vectors |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Person to person | Fecal-oral | Insect Bite |\n| Droplets | Airborne |  |\n|  | Fomites |  |\n![[003a Transmission.png]]\n\n| External Defence | How it protects against infection |\n| --- | --- |\n| Skin | An impervious barrier | \n| Ear | Cerumen inhibits bacterial growth |\n| Trachea and bronchi | Mucus layer traps micro-organisms |\n| Stomach |  |\n| Vagina |  |\n| Nasal cavity |  |\n| Mouth cavity |  |\n| Eyes |  |\n| Urethra |  |\n| Anus |  |\n\n\nA reflex is an automatic, involuntary response to a stimulus.\n\nThe body uses protective reflexes to protect the body from infection.

The body's thermostat is reset to a higher temperature by the **hypothalamus**, the higher temperature can inhibit the growth of some pathogens and can help the immune system fight the disease.\n\n![[003b Inflammation.png|500]]\n\n### Inflammation\n1. Tissue damage activates mast cells to release histamine and heparin into tissue fluid.\n2. Histamine increases blood flow to the area by vasodilation, making capillary walls more permeable. This causes heat, redness and swelling.\n3. Heparin prevents clotting in the immediate area, but a clot forms around that area, protecting nearby tissue.\n4. Complement proteins and other chemical messengers attract phagocytes (especially neutrophils) to consume pathogens.\n5. Dead phagocytes and tissue fluid form pus.\n6. New cells are produced by mitosis, and the wound heals.\n\n## Fever\n\n![[003c Fever.png|500]]\n\n## Phagocytosis\nMacrophages and neutrophils are both phagocytes.\n\n![[003d Phagocytosis.png|300]]\n\n\n## Specific Immunity\n- Cellular or cell-mediated response involves highly-specialized cells that target pathogens inside cells.\n- Humoral or antibody-mediated response targets pathogens in body fluids with antibodies.\n\nLymphocytes are a type of white blood cell found in the blood and lymph nodes. They are produced in bone marrow and lymph tissue.\n\nLymphocytes recognise antigen molecules on the surface of pathogens, and co-ordinate the immune response against the pathogen.\n\n\nAn antigen is any substance capable of causing a specific immune response. They are large molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids or nucleic acid.\n\nAn **antibody** is a Y-shaped protein that is produced by plasma cells in response to an antigen.\nAntibodies belong to a group of proteins called immunoglobulins.\nThe antibody combines with the antigen to form an antigen-antibody complex.\nEach antibody can combine with only one particular antigen.\n\nWhen an antigen enters a body, specific cells recognise them\nThese cells are are **antigen-presenting cells (APCs)**, and include dendritic cells, macrophages and undifferentiated B-cells.\n\nThese cells:\n- detect the presence of an antigen\n- engulf the pathogen\n- digest the pathogen, producing small fragments that move to the surface of the cell\n- present the antigen to lymphocytes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.53774062Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Biology/005-Infectious-Diseases":{"title":"Infectious Diseases","content":"# Infectious Diseases\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\n## Antibiotics\nAntibiotics are a group of drugs used to treat bacterial infections.\nThey are effective against prokaryotic cells but generally leave eukaryotic cells unharmed.\n\nTwo different types of antibiotic:\n- Bactericidal - kill bacterial cells\n- Bacteriostatic - slow the growth or reproduction of bacteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.53774062Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Chemistry/001-Energy-Consumption":{"title":"Energy Consumption","content":"# Energy Consumption\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\n## What is energy?\nEnergy is the ability to do work and is comprised of different types including:\n\t- Potential\n\t- Chemical\n\t- Kinetic\n\t- Heat\n\t- Electromagnetic\n\nIt is a property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat the object\nIt can be transferred from one object to another and transformed between types, but created or destroyed\nEnergy is often categorised as potential (stored) or kinetic (movement)\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.553740545Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Chemistry/002-Fossil-Fuels":{"title":"Making Oil Useful","content":"# Making Oil Useful\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\n## Crude Oil\nMany compounds in crude oil only contain the elements carbon and hydrogen.\n\n**How did we become so reliant on crude oil?**\nFrom the industrial revolution, we been developing things based on \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.553740545Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Chemistry/003-Greenhouse-Gases":{"title":"Greenhouse Effect","content":"# Greenhouse Effect\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\n## The Greenhouse Effect\n![[001 The Greenhouse Effect.png|500]]\n\n\nQ's:\n- The carbon dioxide prevented the energy from escaping from the \"atmosphere\"\n\t- The sun\n\t- Planets\n\t- The atmosphere\n- Keeps the planet warm and distributes the solar radiation evenly across the Earth\n- The Earth's temperature would increase causing melting of ice caps, extinction of species\n- The Earth's atmosphere would keep increasing in temperature which would heat the Earth\n\n\n## Greenhouse Gases\nGreenhouse gases interact with infrared radiation\n- Molecules of GHGs absorb IR radiation\n- Molecules increase their vibrational energy\n- Molecules can re-emit IR radiation, or collide with other substances to pass on kinetic energy\n\n![[002 Order of Greenhouse Effect.png|500]]\n\n\nMain GHGs (in order of proportion of warming affect):\n- Water vapour, H2O\n- Carbon dioxide, CO2\n- Methane, CH4\n- Dinitrogen monoxide, N2O\n- Ozone, O3\n- CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)\n- HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons)\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.557740527Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Chemistry/004-Fractional-Distillation":{"title":"Fractional Distillation","content":"# Factional Distillation\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\nCrude oil is a mixture composed mainly of straight and branched chain **alkanes**\nThe first step is to separate compounds in the oil into groups called fractions\nEach **fraction** contains a mixture of compounds with a similar boiling point\n\nThe mixture is heated until all components evaporate, them cooled in such a fashion that substances condense separately\nSubstances with a higher boiling point condense before substances with a lower boiling point\nFractional distillation is used to separate crude oil into fraction with different boiling points\n\n## Step by step\n![[003 Fractional Distillation.png|200]]\n\n1.

It cannot be measured directly.\n\nDuring reactions, the enthalpy of the reactants and the products is not the same. This results in energy being either given out or taken in during the reaction. This energy is the enthalpy change, ŒîH (delta H)\n\nŒîH is the change of enthalpy with the units of kilojoules per mol (KJ mol$^{-1}$)\n\n## Exothermic Reactions\nExamples (NEED TO MEMORISE):\n- Combustion\n- Respiration\n- Neutralization of acids with alkalis\n- Reactions of metals with acids\n- Displacement reactions\n\n**Exothermic Reaction Profile**\n![[006 Exothermic Reaction Profile.png|400]]\n\n\n## Endothermic Reactions\nExamples (NEED TO MEMORISE):\n- Thermal decomposition\n- Photosynthesis\n- Some types of electrolysis\n- Sherbet\n\n![[007 Endothermic Reaction Profile.png|400]]\n\n\n## Reversable Reactions\n\n‚óèHCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) ‚Üí NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) + heat\n‚óèCuSO4 (aq) + Zn (s) ‚Üí Cu (s) + ZnSO4 (aq) + 217 kJ\n‚óèCH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) ‚Üí CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g);¬†¬†¬† ŒîH = - 890 kJ\n\n\n## Catalysts\nOne way of reducing the energy used in a chemical reaction is to use a **catalyst**. Catalysts allow reactions to take place at a faster rate, and often at a lower temperature.\n\n*A catalyst is a chemical substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the reaction. This means catalysts can be reused.*\n\nCatalysts never increase the yield - they just produce the same amount quicker.\n\nCommon catalysts:\n- Platinum (catalytic converters)\n- Vanadium oxide (sulfuric acid production)\n- Dilute hydrochloric acid (perfume production)\n- Iron (Haber process)\n\n\n### How do catalysts work?\nCatalysts work by reducing the activation energy of a reaction. This is the minimum amount of energy needed for particles to react.\n\n\nQ's:\na) A catalyst is a chemical substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the reaction. It can be reused.\nb) The reaction would result in bubbles being formed if there was a substance to catch the bubbles.\nc) * Add it to fresh hydrogen peroxide to show it will work again.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.557740527Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Physics/001-The-Atom":{"title":"The Atom","content":"# The Atom\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\n## Isotopes\n***Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.***\n\nThe nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force, the force between two nucleons.\n\nThe electrostatic force pushes the nucleus apart (protons repel each other) but the strong nuclear force wins over short distances.\n\nElectrostatic attraction holds the electrons in their energy levels around the nucleus.\n\n\nProtons repel each other, so the strong nuclear force can only hold a nucleus together when there are enough neutrons in the nucleus to space the protons out.\n\nThe numbers of protons and neutrons need to be just right.\nSome nuclei are naturally unstable, and break apart, emitting particles and/or energy.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.573740452Z","tags":null},"/notes/2022/001f_Science/Physics/002-Types-of-Radiation":{"title":"Types of Radiation - INCOMPLETE","content":"# Types of Radiation - INCOMPLETE\n[[001_Notes/2022/001f_Science/Science Index|Index]]\n\n**This page is incomplete.

Introduction/Powerpoint]]\n\n#### Types of Resources\n\n- There are three main types of **resources**, also known as **factors of production**\n\n- Natural\n\n- Human\n\n- Capital\n\n###### Natural Resources\n\n- The gifts of nature; resources such as air, minerals, water, coal, oil\n\n#### Micro and Macroeconomics\n\n- The subject matter of economics is divided into micro and macroeconomics\n\n- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view\n\n- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy\n\n- **Micro**economics deals with economics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective\n\n#### Economic Models\n\n- A **simplified** representation of economic reality showing the relationship between certain economic variables\n\n- Not inclusive of all detailed; simplified to show key correlations\n\n- It is assumed that people have **rational self-interest** - that economic decisions are based on a person following a logical process\n\n- Rationality is determined as benefit exceeding cost\n\n- Price is useful for measuring both\n\n###### Positive and Normative\n\n- Beside developing models, **developing theory is known as positive economics** - 'what is' in the economy\n\n- On the other hand, normative economics is the domain of 'what should be' - largely opinionated\n\n- Normative statements involve a **value judgement** - an opinion that one situation is preferable above another","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.573740452Z","tags":null},"/notes/2023/002_Economics/001_Chapter-Summaries/Chapter-2":{"title":"Chapter 2","content":"# Summary Notes - CH2\n\n#### The Role of Markets\n- Economic systems exist to deal with the economic problem, in order to answer the basic economic problem\n- A **market** is said to exist when buyers and sellers exchange goods, services or resources. A market consists of three elements\n- Buyers $\\rightarrow$ Create Demand\n- Sellers $\\rightarrow$ Create Supply\n- Something to exchange (goods \u0026 services)\n- Markets must be voluntary exchange\n- There exist [[#Competitive Markets]] and [[#Imperfect Markets]]\n- In the market system, the key economic questions are answered by the **price mechanism**\n- The consumer is king (consumer sovereignty), and they determine the answers to the BEP questions.\n- Markets are guided by self-interest on both the supply and demand side\n###### Competitive Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A large number of buyers and sellers\n- Firms being price takers\n- Homogenous products\n- Easy entry into market (no barriers)\n\n###### Imperfect Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A small number of firms\n- Product differentiation\n- Firms being price setters\n- Restricted entry into market\n- An **extreme imperfect market** is a monopoly market, where the market is centered around one fir,.\n- An oligopoly is a market with a few dominant firms\n\n#### Demand Side\n\n- Demand refers to the buying intentions of customers.\n- This is not a want; wants are desired but demands are desires characterised by an ability to actually buy.\n- Demand is governed by the law of demand\n- **Income effect** - higher income $\\rightarrow$ more purchasing power\n- **Substitution effect** - when the price of a substitute increases, the price of the good increases as it becomes more attractive to buyers.\n- The effects hold true always, as long as all other factors are constant\n\n###### Changes in the Demand Curve\n- There are two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Supply Side\n- Represents the sellers or producers side of the market.\n- Rational, self-interested suppliers prefer to sell their output at a higher price than a lower one in order to maximise gain\n\n###### Changes in the Supply Curve\n- There are once again two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Equilibrium\n- If we graph supply \u0026 demand on the same curve we can draw the equilibrium quantity and price as the points where the **two curves intersect**\n- Balances buying intentions of customer with selling intentions of supplier\n- If **the price is below the equilibrium**, there will be a **shortage**, and a **surplus** above.\n\n###### Shifts\n- When there are shifts in either curve, the equilbrium will change. In order for there not to be a surplus or shortage, the price will naturally increase or decrease by\n- **Suppliers selling excess stock** at a **lower price**\n- **Customers bidding up the price** due to lack of supply\n- In the time this takes to happen, there will be a temporary shortage or surplus\n\n###### Simultaneous Shifts\n- What if both the **demand** *and* **supply** curves shifted at the same time?\n- They could have different effects, detailed in the table below\n| **Type of Shift** | **Effect on Price ** | **Effect on Quantity** | **(Temporary) Shortage or Surplus?** |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| $\\uparrow D$ | Increase | Increase | Shortage |\n| $\\downarrow D$ | Decrease | Decrease | Surplus |\n| $\\uparrow S$ | Decrease | Increase | Surplus |\n| $\\downarrow S$ | Increase | Decrease | Shortage |\n| $\\uparrow D \\uparrow S$ | Indeterminate | Increase | N/A |\n| $\\uparrow D \\downarrow S$ | Increase | Indeterminate | Shortage |\n| $\\downarrow D \\uparrow S$ | Decrease | Indeterminate | Surplus |\n| $\\downarrow D \\downarrow S$ | Indeterminate | Decrease | N/A |\n\n- We can observe **indeterminate** values for the simultaneous shifts; these depend on the **magnitude of the shift**\n- Could increase, decrease, or stay the same\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.577740433Z","tags":null},"/notes/2023/002_Economics/002_Notes/001_Intro-NEED-TO-FORMAT":{"title":"Intro","content":"\nOpportunity cost is the alternative option in a choice.\n\nPositive economics is the testing and developing economic theory -

decrease in price\n-   Contraction - increase in price\n\n#### Shift\n-   The quantity demanded of the changes at every price\n-   Due to change in non-price factors\n-   Rightward shift - increase in demand\n-   Leftward shift - decrease in demand\n\n### Non price factors (TEPID)\n-   Tastes and preferences\n-   Price of related goods\n-   Substitutes\n-   Complements\n-   Level of disposable income\n-   Normal goods - as income increases, demand increases\n-   Inferior - as income increases, demand decrease\n-   Demographic factors\n\t-   Age, gender, socioeconomic status\n-   Expectations of consumers\n\t-   Consumers may decrease consumption if they are expecting prices to fall\n\nFactors that would increase demand:\n-   Price of movie tickets increase, increase demand for streaming services -

New equilibrium - Compare\n\n\n\n\n### One Way Shifts\nDecrease in demand:\n\tThere is an increase in price of complementary goods causing a decrease in demand, shifting the demand curve to the left from D to D1. At the original price point, Quantity supplied, $Q_e$, exceeds Quantity demanded, $Q_2$. There is a temporary surplus from $Q_e$ to $Q_2$. Firms decrease the price to get rid of excess stock leading to a contraction along the supply curve, causing an expansion along the D curve. The temporary surplus is cleared and the new equilibrium point is at a lower price point, P3 and at a higher quantity, $Q_3$.\n\n### Two Way Shifts\nDecrease in supply, increase in demand:\n\tThere is a non-price factor that is causing an increase in demand, shifting the demand curve to the right from $D$ to $D_1$ and a non-price factor causing a decrease in supply, shifting the supply curve to the left, from $S_1$ to $S_2$. At the original price point, quantity demanded, $Q_3$, exceeds quantity supplied, $Q_2$. There is a temporary shortage from $Q_2$ to $Q_3$. Consumers bid up the price leading to contraction along the demand curve, leading to an expansion along the supply curve. The temporary shortage is cleared and the new equilibrium point is at a higher price point, $P_2$, and at an indeterminate quantity, $Q_1$.\n\n\nIncrease in supply, decrease in demand:\n\tThere is new technology causing an increase in supply shifting the supply curve to the right from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and there is a decrease in disposable income causing a decrease in demand shifting the demand curve to the right from $D_1$ to $D_2$. At the original price point, quantity supplied, $Q_3$, exceeds quantity supplied, $Q_2$. There is a temporary surplus from $Q_2$ to $Q_3$. Firms decrease the price to get rid of excess stock leading to a contraction along the supply curve, causing an expansion the $D$ curve.

this is in the odd form ([[#Introduction]]) - we must complete that however by stating $for \\space some \\space n+m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- $\\therefore Q.E.D$; from above it is obviously proved, but we should wrap it up - **Q.E.D essentially means** *it is proved, as you can obviously see*\n\n- There may be more complex examples\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- These will require **factorisation** and algebraic manipulation, and expanded reasoning\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- The logic stays the same though\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- **Knights and Knaves** questions will almost always require the consideration of *all cases*\n\n  \n\n#### Proof by Contrapositive\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Sometimes it is difficult to prove $P \\implies Q$ through direct proof; consider\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd` ¬†\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- We can't assume `P` ($n^{2}+2n+1$) because it is difficult to define\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- However we can use the contrapositive\n\n- **The contrapositive of** $P \\implies Q$ is $Q' \\implies P'$ (the **negated things in the opposite order**\n\n  \n\n###### Negation\n\n- Making something opposite is called **negation** - the negation of $1+1=2$ is $1+1 \\not = 2$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- We can, however, encounter more difficult negations.\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- Consider `negation of (6 is divisible by 2 and 3)`\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- We can use De morgan's laws for this\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- `not (P and Q) is the same as (not P) or (not Q)`\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- `not (P or Q) is the same as (not P) and (not Q)`\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- Therefore the above becomes `6 is not divisible by 2 or 6 is not divisible by 3`\n\n  \n\n###### Using Negation for the Contrapositive\n\n- For the above, `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd`\n\n- **If the original P =\u003e Q is true, it's contrapositive will always be true, and vice versa**\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- The above is therefore true and can be directly proved\n\n  \n\n##### Proof\n\n- Let us consider the above; `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd`\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- First, we should negate both sides and flip them - writing the contrapositive\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- This is `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd` in the form $P \\implies Q$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- $let \\space n = 2a \\space for \\space some \\space a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- $n^{2}+2n+1 = (2a)^{2}+2(2a)+1$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- $=4a^2+4a+1$; getting us into even number accounted form\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- $=2(a^{2}+2a)+1$; it may seem like we are doing little but this puts us in the traditional odd form\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- $for \\space some ¬†\\space a^{2}+2a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- $\\therefore Q.E.D$\n\n  \n\n#### Equivalence Proofs\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Equivalent Statements are given in the form $P \\iff Q$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- To prove equivalence though, we must first prove a statement **and** [[#The converse]]\n\n- In written form, $P \\iff Q$ is `P is true if and only if Q is true`, for example;\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- `Your heart is beating if and only if you are alive` (this is an equivalent statement)\n\n- If a question includes `if and only if`, remember to consider both cases\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- To indicate the case being proven, write $\\implies$ or $\\impliedby$\n\n  \n\n##### The converse\n\n- If a statement $P \\implies Q$ exists, then the converse is simply $Q \\implies P$\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- i.e the contrapositive with less steps\n\n  \n\n#### Disproving of Statements\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- In general, when **disproving** statements, we only need **one example**\n\n- There are, however, two types of statements you may have to disprove;\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- **Universal Quantification** (also known as *for all*).\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- `For all natural numbers n, 2n \u003e n + 1`\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- The above statement can only be **proved** by providing an argument concerning all natural numbers *n*\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- **Existential Quantification** (also known as *there exists*)\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- `There exists an integer m such that m^2 = 25`\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- Due to the nature of this statement, we only need one integer *m* to **prove** the statement\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- Both of these statements involve quantifiers. In order to disprove, we should know [[#Negating Quantifiers]]\n\n  \n\n##### Negating Quantifiers\n\n- To negate quantifiers, we just swap 'there exists' and 'for all' and then *negate the rest of the statement*\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- `For all natural numbers n, 2n \u003e n+1` $\\rightarrow$ `There exists natural number n such that 2n \u003c n + 1`\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- And vice versa.\n\n  \n\n##### Disproving\n\n- **Universal Quantifications**\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- Can be disproved via `counterexample` - this is because it asserts truth without exception.\n\n- **Existential Quantification**\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ- This is different - because this involves a *there exists* (truth with exceptions), we must prove that there does not exist at all\n\n\t\t- Due to this, we must prove **the negation to be true** ([[#Negating Quantifiers]])\n\n\n##### Proof by Induction\n\t- State the Proposition: P(n)\n\t- Try for P(1)\n\t- Assume P(k)\n\t- Try for P(k+1)\n\n\n$7^{k} - 4 = 3m$\n$7^{k+1}-4 = 7(7^{k}-4)+24$\n\t\t\t $= 7(3m)+24$\n\t\t\t $=3(7m+8)$\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.577740433Z","tags":null},"/notes/2023/004_Physics/001_Vectors":{"title":"Vectors","content":"## Vectors\n- A vector is a quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**.\n\n#### Horizontal\nThere are two ways to describe horizontal vectors:\n- Full circle/True bearing\n- Quadrant bearing\n\n##### True Bearing (TB)\n- North is at 0$\\degree$ true\n- All directions are given as clockwise from north\n\n##### Quadrant Bearing (QB)\n- Angles are referenced from either north or south\n- Angles are $0\\degree\\le x \\le 90 \\degree$ to East or West\n\n#### Vertical\n- Vectors are referenced to the vertical\n- Vectors are $0\\degree\\le x \\le 90 \\degree$\n- E.g. 60$\\degree$T = $30\\degree$ up from the horizontal to the right OR 60$\\degree$ down from the vertical to the right\n\n\n### Vector Addition\n- $\\vec{u} = \\vec{v} + \\vec{w}$\n- Put the vectors tail to tip\n- Use trig to work out angle and resultant vector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.577740433Z","tags":null},"/notes/2023/004_Physics/002_Sig-Fig-+-Uncertainty":{"title":"Significant Figures and Uncertainty","content":"## Significant Figures and Uncertainty\n\n### Rules\n- Zeros in front of the integer part are not significant\n- All non-zero figures are significant\n- All zeros between non-zero digits are significant\n- All zeros to the right of the decimal point are significant\n- For numbers \u003c 1, the zeros before the first non-zero digit are not significant\n\n**Above rules apply when the number is between 10 and 1000**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.577740433Z","tags":null},"/notes/2023/004_Physics/Index":{"title":"Physics","content":"\n## Notes\n- [[001_Notes/2023/004_Physics/001_Vectors|Vectors]]\n- [[001_Notes/2023/004_Physics/002_Sig Fig + Uncertainty|Significant Figures and Uncertainty]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.577740433Z","tags":null},"/notes/2023/Index":{"title":"Year 11","content":"# Year 11\n## Subjects\n\n- [[001_Notes/2023/001_ComputerScience/Index|Computer Science]]\n- [[001_Notes/2023/002_Economics/Index|Economics]]\n- [[001_Notes/2023/003_Specialist/Index|Specialist]]\n\t- No notes under Spec yet\n- [[001_Notes/2023/004_Physics/Index|Physics]]\n\t- In progress of being uploaded\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-27T03:07:47.577740433Z","tags":null}}
