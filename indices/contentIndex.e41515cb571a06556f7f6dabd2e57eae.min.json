resources such as air, minerals, water, coal, oil\n\n#### Micro and Macroeconomics\n\n- The subject matter of economics is divided into micro and macroeconomics\n\n- **Macro**economics deals with the economic problem from society's point of view\n\n- It is concerned with the performance of the whole economy\n\n- **Micro**economics deals with economics from an individual point of view - referring to a small perspective\n\n#### Economic Models\n\n- A **simplified** representation of economic reality showing the relationship between certain economic variables\n\n- Not inclusive of all detailed; simplified to show key correlations\n\n- It is assumed that people have **rational self-interest** - that economic decisions are based on a person following a logical process\n\n- Rationality is determined as benefit exceeding cost\n\n- Price is useful for measuring both\n\n###### Positive and Normative\n\n- Beside developing models, **developing theory is known as positive economics** - 'what is' in the economy\n\n- On the other hand, normative economics is the domain of 'what should be' - largely opinionated\n\n- Normative statements involve a **value judgement** - an opinion that one situation is preferable above another","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T08:58:52.181377977Z","tags":null},"/notes/AEECO-Chapter-2":{"title":"Chapter 2","content":"# Summary Notes - CH2\n\n#### The Role of Markets\n- Economic systems exist to deal with the economic problem, in order to answer the basic economic problem\n- A **market** is said to exist when buyers and sellers exchange goods, services or resources. A market consists of three elements\n- Buyers $\\rightarrow$ Create Demand\n- Sellers $\\rightarrow$ Create Supply\n- Something to exchange (goods \u0026 services)\n- Markets must be voluntary exchange\n- There exist [[#Competitive Markets]] and [[#Imperfect Markets]]\n- In the market system, the key economic questions are answered by the **price mechanism**\n- The consumer is king (consumer sovereignty), and they determine the answers to the BEP questions.\n- Markets are guided by self-interest on both the supply and demand side\n###### Competitive Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A large number of buyers and sellers\n- Firms being price takers\n- Homogenous products\n- Easy entry into market (no barriers)\n\n###### Imperfect Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A small number of firms\n- Product differentiation\n- Firms being price setters\n- Restricted entry into market\n- An **extreme imperfect market** is a monopoly market, where the market is centred around one firm.\n- An oligopoly is a market with a few dominant firms\n\n#### Demand Side\n\n- Demand refers to the buying intentions of customers.\n- This is not a want; wants are desired but demands are desires characterised by an ability to actually buy.\n- Demand is governed by the law of demand\n- **Income effect** - higher income $\\rightarrow$ more purchasing power\n- **Substitution effect** - when the price of a substitute increases, the price of the good increases as it becomes more attractive to buyers.\n- The effects hold true always, as long as all other factors are constant\n\n###### Changes in the Demand Curve\n- There are two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Supply Side\n- Represents the sellers or producers side of the market.\n- Rational, self-interested suppliers prefer to sell their output at a higher price than a lower one in order to maximise gain\n\n###### Changes in the Supply Curve\n- There are once again two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Equilibrium\n- If we graph supply \u0026 demand on the same curve we can draw the equilibrium quantity and price as the points where the **two curves intersect**\n- Balances buying intentions of customer with selling intentions of supplier\n- If **the price is below the equilibrium**, there will be a **shortage**, and a **surplus** above.\n\n###### Shifts\n- When there are shifts in either curve, the equilibrium will change. In order for there not to be a surplus or shortage, the price will naturally increase or decrease by\n- **Suppliers selling excess stock** at a **lower price**\n- **Customers bidding up the price** due to lack of supply\n- In the time this takes to happen, there will be a temporary shortage or surplus\n\n###### Simultaneous Shifts\n- What if both the **demand** *and* **supply** curves shifted at the same time?\n- They could have different effects, detailed in the table below\n| **Type of Shift** | **Effect on Price ** | **Effect on Quantity** | **(Temporary) Shortage or Surplus?** |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| $\\uparrow D$ | Increase | Increase | Shortage |\n| $\\downarrow D$ | Decrease | Decrease | Surplus |\n| $\\uparrow S$ | Decrease | Increase | Surplus |\n| $\\downarrow S$ | Increase | Decrease | Shortage |\n| $\\uparrow D \\uparrow S$ | Indeterminate | Increase | N/A |\n| $\\uparrow D \\downarrow S$ | Increase | Indeterminate | Shortage |\n| $\\downarrow D \\uparrow S$ | Decrease | Indeterminate | Surplus |\n| $\\downarrow D \\downarrow S$ | Indeterminate | Decrease | N/A |\n\n- We can observe **indeterminate** values for the simultaneous shifts;

At the original price point, Quantity supplied, $Q_e$, exceeds Quantity demanded, $Q_2$. There is a temporary surplus from $Q_e$ to $Q_2$. Firms decrease the price to get rid of excess stock leading to a contraction along the supply curve, causing an expansion along the D curve. The temporary surplus is cleared and the new equilibrium point is at a lower price point, P3 and at a higher quantity, $Q_3$.\n\n### Two Way Shifts\nDecrease in supply, increase in demand:\n\tThere is a non-price factor that is causing an increase in demand, shifting the demand curve to the right from $D$ to $D_1$ and a non-price factor causing a decrease in supply, shifting the supply curve to the left, from $S_1$ to $S_2$. At the original price point, quantity demanded, $Q_3$, exceeds quantity supplied, $Q_2$. There is a temporary shortage from $Q_2$ to $Q_3$. Consumers bid up the price leading to contraction along the demand curve, leading to an expansion along the supply curve. The temporary shortage is cleared and the new equilibrium point is at a higher price point, $P_2$, and at an indeterminate quantity, $Q_1$.\n\n\nIncrease in supply, decrease in demand:\n\tThere is new technology causing an increase in supply shifting the supply curve to the right from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and there is a decrease in disposable income causing a decrease in demand shifting the demand curve to the right from $D_1$ to $D_2$.

The consumers bears a higher burden of the tax compared to the producers. \n\n\n### Factors Affecting PED\n#### The availability of substitutes\n- If there are lots of substitutes - more elastic\n- If there are no substitutes - less elastic (Inelastic)\n\n#### Whether the good is a necessity or a luxury\n- If a good is a necessity - Inelastic\n- If a good is a luxury - Elastic\n\n#### Proportion  of income spent\n- The greater proportion of income, the more elastic\n- Cheaper goods are less elastic than expensive goods\n\n#### Time period considered\n- The longer consumers to have to respond to changes, the more elastic\n- As time goes on, goods become more elastic\n\n#### The definition of the market\n- Narrower the market, the more responsive (Elastic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T08:58:52.181377977Z","tags":null},"/notes/AEECO-Intro":{"title":"Intro","content":"## Opportunity cost\nOpportunity cost is the alternative option in a choice.\n\nPositive economics is the testing and developing economic theory - subjects that are testable.\n\nNormative economics reflects opinions rather than facts - cannot be tested objectively.\n- **+ve** - If we increase government health spending, it will increase public expenditure.\n- **-ve** - We should increase government spending.\n\n### Economic models\n-   Simplified representation of economic reality showing relationships between certain economic variables\n-   Determine cause and affect\n\n### Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)\n-   Shows all combination of goods and services that can be produced by an economy given the available resources and level of technology.\n\n## Market Economy\n-   An economy that solves the economic problem in a network of separate but interconnected markets.\n\n#### Markets have\n-   Buyers and sellers (create supply and demand)\n-   A commodity\n-   Voluntary exchange\n-   A process, mechanism or arrangement through which buyers and sellers meet\n\n### Product market\n- Goods and services\n- Households supply, firms demand\n\n### Factor market\n- Firms demand, households supply\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T08:58:52.181377977Z","tags":null},"/notes/AEMAS-Proofs":{"title":"AEMAS - Proofs","content":"#### Introduction\n\n- Proofs demonstrate the absolute truth of a statement, and should aim to achieve three things\n\n      - Correctness\n\n      - Clarity\n\n      - Simplicity\n\n- In proving statements, we should know some basic algebraic representations\n\n\t - `Even numbers` -  *$2m$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$*\n\n     - `Odd numbers` - *$2m + 1$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$*\n\n     - `Divisible by `$a$ -  *$am$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$*\n\n     - `Perfect Square` - *There exists* $a^2$ *for some* $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n     - `Prime` - *There does not exist* $ab$ *for some* $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ *and* $a,b\u003e1$\n\n- There are different ways to prove a statement, these are discussed below\n\n\n\n\n#### Direct Proof\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Direct proofs are in response to conditional statements, for example\n\n      - `If it is raining, then the grass is wet`\n\n      - In the form `If P is true, then Q is true`\n\n      - This is mathematically represented $P \\implies Q$ (`P` implies `Q`)\n\n            - `P` is the hypothesis, and `Q` is the conclusion\n\n- Not all conditional statements are true.\n\n  \n\n##### The Proof\n\n- To give a **direct** proof of a statement $P \\implies Q$, we must assume the hypothesis (P) to be true and show the conclusion (Q)\n\n- **Example**\n\n      - `If a is odd and b is even, then a + b is odd`\n\n      - $let \\space a = 2n+1 \\space for \\space some \\space n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (we must include for some)\n\n      - $let \\space b=2m \\space for \\space some \\space b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (second definition)\n\n      - $a+b=2n+1+2m$\n\n      - $=2(n+m)+1$; this is in the odd form ([[#Introduction]]) - we must complete that however by stating $for \\space some \\space n+m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n      - $\\therefore Q.E.D$; from above it is obviously proved, but we should wrap it up - **Q.E.D essentially means** *it is proved, as you can obviously see*\n\n- There may be more complex examples\n\n      - These will require **factorisation** and algebraic manipulation, and expanded reasoning\n\n      - The logic stays the same though\n\n      - **Knights and Knaves** questions will almost always require the consideration of *all cases*\n\n  \n\n#### Proof by Contrapositive\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Sometimes it is difficult to prove $P \\implies Q$ through direct proof; consider\n\n      - `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd`  \n\n      - We can't assume `P` ($n^{2}+2n+1$) because it is difficult to define\n\n      - However we can use the contrapositive\n\n- **The contrapositive of** $P \\implies Q$ is $Q' \\implies P'$ (the **negated things in the opposite order**\n\n  \n\n###### Negation\n\n- Making something opposite is called **negation** - the negation of $1+1=2$ is $1+1 \\not = 2$\n\n      - We can, however, encounter more difficult negations.\n\n      - Consider `negation of (6 is divisible by 2 and 3)`\n\n      - We can use De morgan's laws for this\n\n            - `not (P and Q) is the same as (not P) or (not Q)`\n\n            - `not (P or Q) is the same as (not P) and (not Q)`\n\n      - Therefore the above becomes `6 is not divisible by 2 or 6 is not divisible by 3`\n\n  \n\n###### Using Negation for the Contrapositive\n\n- For the above, `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd`\n\n- **If the original P =\u003e Q is true, it's contrapositive will always be true, and vice versa**\n\n      - The above is therefore true and can be directly proved\n\n  \n\n##### Proof\n\n- Let us consider the above; `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd`\n\n      - First, we should negate both sides and flip them - writing the contrapositive\n\n      - This is `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd` in the form $P \\implies Q$\n\n      - $let \\space n = 2a \\space for \\space some \\space a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n      - $n^{2}+2n+1 = (2a)^{2}+2(2a)+1$\n\n      - $=4a^2+4a+1$; getting us into even number accounted form\n\n      - $=2(a^{2}+2a)+1$; it may seem like we are doing little but this puts us in the traditional odd form\n\n            - $for \\space some  \\space a^{2}+2a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n      - $\\therefore Q.E.D$\n\n  \n\n#### Equivalence Proofs\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Equivalent Statements are given in the form $P \\iff Q$\n\n      - To prove equivalence though, we must first prove a statement **and** [[#The converse]]\n\n- In written form, $P \\iff Q$ is `P is true if and only if Q is true`, for example;\n\n      - `Your heart is beating if and only if you are alive` (this is an equivalent statement)\n\n- If a question includes `if and only if`, remember to consider both cases\n\n      - To indicate the case being proven, write $\\implies$ or $\\impliedby$\n\n  \n\n##### The converse\n\n- If a statement $P \\implies Q$ exists, then the converse is simply $Q \\implies P$\n\n      - i.e the contrapositive with less steps\n\n  \n\n#### Disproving of Statements\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- In general, when **disproving** statements, we only need **one example**\n\n- There are, however, two types of statements you may have to disprove;\n\n      - **Universal Quantification** (also known as *for all*).\n\n            - `For all natural numbers n, 2n \u003e n + 1`\n\n            - The above statement can only be **proved** by providing an argument concerning all natural numbers *n*\n\n      - **Existential Quantification** (also known as *there exists*)\n\n            - `There exists an integer m such that m^2 = 25`\n\n            - Due to the nature of this statement, we only need one integer *m* to **prove** the statement\n\n      - Both of these statements involve quantifiers. In order to disprove, we should know [[#Negating Quantifiers]]\n\n  \n\n##### Negating Quantifiers\n\n- To negate quantifiers, we just swap 'there exists' and 'for all' and then *negate the rest of the statement*\n\n      - `For all natural numbers n, 2n \u003e n+1` $\\rightarrow$ `There exists natural number n such that 2n \u003c n + 1`\n\n      - And vice versa.\n\n  \n\n##### Disproving\n\n- **Universal Quantifications**\n\n      - Can be disproved via `counterexample` - this is because it asserts truth without exception.\n\n- **Existential Quantification**\n\n      - This is different - because this involves a *there exists* (truth with exceptions), we must prove that there does not exist at all\n\n\t\t- Due to this, we must prove **the negation to be true** ([[#Negating Quantifiers]])\n\n\n##### Proof by Induction\n\t- State the Proposition: P(n)\n\t- Try for P(1)\n\t- Assume P(k)\n\t- Try for P(k+1)\n\n\n$7^{k} - 4 = 3m$\n$7^{k+1}-4 = 7(7^{k}-4)+24$\n\t\t\t $= 7(3m)+24$\n\t\t\t $=3(7m+8)$\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T08:58:52.181377977Z","tags":null},"/notes/Computer-Science":{"title":"Computer Science","content":"\n## Programming\n- Please note that these notes are incomplete\n\n- [[notes/AECSC - Intro|Intro]]\n- [[notes/AECSC - Binary|Binary]]\n- [[notes/AECSC - Pseudocode|Pseudocode]]\n- [[notes/AECSC - Iterations|Iterations]]\n- [[notes/AECSC - Case|Case]]\n- [[notes/AECSC - Functions|Functions]]\n- [[notes/AECSC - Arrays|Arrays]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T08:58:52.181377977Z","tags":null},"/notes/Economics":{"title":"Economics","content":"### Chapter Summaries\n- These are chapter summaries from the textbook\n- [[notes/AEECO - Chapter 1|Chapter 1]]\n- [[notes/AEECO - Chapter 2|Chapter 2]]\n\n### Notes\n- [[AEECO - Intro|Intro]]\n- [[notes/AEECO - Demand and Supply|Demand and Supply]]\n- [[notes/AEECO - Elasticity|Elasticity]] - In progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-02T08:58:52.181377977Z","tags":null}}
