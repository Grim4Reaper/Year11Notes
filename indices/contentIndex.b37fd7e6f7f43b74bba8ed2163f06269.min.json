simplified to show key correlations\n\n- It is assumed that people have **rational self-interest** - that economic decisions are based on a person following a logical process\n\n- Rationality is determined as benefit exceeding cost\n\n- Price is useful for measuring both\n\n###### Positive and Normative\n\n- Beside developing models, **developing theory is known as positive economics** - 'what is' in the economy\n\n- On the other hand, normative economics is the domain of 'what should be' - largely opinionated\n\n- Normative statements involve a **value judgement** - an opinion that one situation is preferable above another","lastmodified":"2023-05-05T04:29:07.413154388Z","tags":null},"/notes/AEECO-Chapter-2":{"title":"Chapter 2","content":"# Summary Notes - CH2\n\n#### The Role of Markets\n- Economic systems exist to deal with the economic problem, in order to answer the basic economic problem\n- A **market** is said to exist when buyers and sellers exchange goods, services or resources. A market consists of three elements\n- Buyers $\\rightarrow$ Create Demand\n- Sellers $\\rightarrow$ Create Supply\n- Something to exchange (goods \u0026 services)\n- Markets must be voluntary exchange\n- There exist [[#Competitive Markets]] and [[#Imperfect Markets]]\n- In the market system, the key economic questions are answered by the **price mechanism**\n- The consumer is king (consumer sovereignty), and they determine the answers to the BEP questions.\n- Markets are guided by self-interest on both the supply and demand side\n###### Competitive Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A large number of buyers and sellers\n- Firms being price takers\n- Homogenous products\n- Easy entry into market (no barriers)\n\n###### Imperfect Markets\n- Characterised by;\n- A small number of firms\n- Product differentiation\n- Firms being price setters\n- Restricted entry into market\n- An **extreme imperfect market** is a monopoly market, where the market is centred around one firm.\n- An oligopoly is a market with a few dominant firms\n\n#### Demand Side\n\n- Demand refers to the buying intentions of customers.\n- This is not a want; wants are desired but demands are desires characterised by an ability to actually buy.\n- Demand is governed by the law of demand\n- **Income effect** - higher income $\\rightarrow$ more purchasing power\n- **Substitution effect** - when the price of a substitute increases, the price of the good increases as it becomes more attractive to buyers.\n- The effects hold true always, as long as all other factors are constant\n\n###### Changes in the Demand Curve\n- There are two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Supply Side\n- Represents the sellers or producers side of the market.\n- Rational, self-interested suppliers prefer to sell their output at a higher price than a lower one in order to maximise gain\n\n###### Changes in the Supply Curve\n- There are once again two changes\n- **Shifts** - a shift of the whole curve left or right (a decrease or increase) caused by a **non-price factor**\n- **Movements** - a movement along the curve caused by a **change in price**\n\n#### Equilibrium\n- If we graph supply \u0026 demand on the same curve we can draw the equilibrium quantity and price as the points where the **two curves intersect**\n- Balances buying intentions of customer with selling intentions of supplier\n- If **the price is below the equilibrium**, there will be a **shortage**, and a **surplus** above.\n\n###### Shifts\n- When there are shifts in either curve, the equilibrium will change. In order for there not to be a surplus or shortage, the price will naturally increase or decrease by\n- **Suppliers selling excess stock** at a **lower price**\n- **Customers bidding up the price** due to lack of supply\n- In the time this takes to happen, there will be a temporary shortage or surplus\n\n###### Simultaneous Shifts\n- What if both the **demand** *and* **supply** curves shifted at the same time?\n- They could have different effects, detailed in the table below\n| **Type of Shift** | **Effect on Price ** | **Effect on Quantity** | **(Temporary) Shortage or Surplus?** |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| $\\uparrow D$ | Increase | Increase | Shortage |\n| $\\downarrow D$ | Decrease | Decrease | Surplus |\n| $\\uparrow S$ | Decrease | Increase | Surplus |\n| $\\downarrow S$ | Increase | Decrease | Shortage |\n| $\\uparrow D \\uparrow S$ | Indeterminate | Increase | N/A |\n| $\\uparrow D \\downarrow S$ | Increase | Indeterminate | Shortage |\n| $\\downarrow D \\uparrow S$ | Decrease | Indeterminate | Surplus |\n| $\\downarrow D \\downarrow S$ | Indeterminate | Decrease | N/A |\n\n- We can observe **indeterminate** values for the simultaneous shifts; these depend on the **magnitude of the shift**\n- Could increase, decrease, or stay the same\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-05T04:29:07.413154388Z","tags":null},"/notes/AEECO-Chapter-3":{"title":"Chapter 3","content":"# Price Elasticity\n## Price Elasticity of demand\n- Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price\n- Price elasticity of demand (Ed) can be calculated by Percentage Change\n$$Ed = \\frac{\\% change \\space in \\space quantity \\space demanded}{\\%  \\space change \\space in \\space price}$$\n\n\n### Price Elastic Goods\nThe quantity demanded of the product is relatively responsive to changes in price.\n- Percentage change in quantity demanded \u003e Percentage change in price\n- $|Ed| \u003e 1$\n\n### Price Inelastic Goods\nThe quantity demanded of the product is relatively unresponsive to changes in price\n- \n\n#### Special Situations\n**Perfectly elastic**\n- $Ed = \\infty$ \n\t- So if price changes, quantity demanded falls to zero\n\n**Perfectly inelastic**\n- $Ed = 0$\n\t- Quantity demanded remains the same regardless of price\n\n**Unitary elastic**\n- $Ed = 1$\n\t- Changes in price equals the change in demand\n\n\n### Measuring Elasticity\n#### Midpoint Method\n$$Ed = |\\frac{(Q_{2} - Q_1)/[(Q_2 + Q_1)/2]}{(P_{2} - P_{1})/[(P_{2 +}P_1)/2]}|$$\n$Ed = |\\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q_{Avg}} * \\frac{P_{Avg}}{\\Delta P}|$\n\n#### Point Method\n$Ed = |\\frac{\\Delta Q}{Q_{}} * \\frac{P_{}}{\\Delta P}|$\n\n\n\n### Revenue\nTR = P * Q\n| Elasticity | Price      | Revenue      |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |\n| Elastic    | $\\uparrow$ | $\\downarrow$ |\n| Inelastic  | $\\uparrow$ | $\\uparrow$ |\n\nTotal revenue = Price * Quantity\n- Effect of changes in price on total revenue is dependent on the price elasticity of the product\n\nWhen price decreases\n- Price elastic product: Total revenue would increase\n- Price inelastic product: Total revenue would decrease\n- Unit elastic: No change in total revenue\n\n### Tax\nDepending on the elasticity, tax revenue and the burden of the tax would vary.\nTax incidence/burden of the tax: Who bears the majority of the tax\n- If a good is price inelastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is higher and the burden of the tax falls more on the consumers\n- If a good is price elastic in demand, the amount of tax revenue is lower and the burden of the tax falls more on the producers\n\n\n#### Elastic\n**Tax** $= P_{2} - P_3$\n**Tax revenue** $= Q_2(P_{2} - P_{1})$\n\nProducer burden \u003e Consumer burden\n\n#### Inelastic\n**Tax** $= P_{2} - P_3$\n**Tax revenue** $= Q_2(P_{2} - P_{1})$\n\nConsumer burden ($P_{2} - P_{1}$) \u003e Producer burden ($P_{1} - P_{3}$)\n\n##### Example Explanation (Inelastic)\nOriginal price point stuff.\nIndirect tax will shift the supply curve to the left, the amount of tax.

Synergy, Australia Post\n- Oligopoly\n\t- Is a market with a few large dominant firms\n\t- E.g. Coles and Woolworths dominate the grocery market in Australia\n\nIn an imperfect market, firms are said to have market or 'monopoly' power which means that they can set the price.\n\nHigher prices in imperfect markets due to less competition.\n\n### Barriers to Enter\n- Are an important feature of imperfect markets\n\n\u003e [!DEFINITION] Definition\n\u003e A barrier to entry is anything that restricts or blocks the entry of new firms into an industry or market.\n\u003e They may include government regulation, and patents, technology barriers, start-up costs and licensing requirements.\n\n#### Examples\nControlling a scarce resource\n- If a mining company pegged the only diamond mine in the country, it would have sole rights to mine the gems\n\nA Government licence granting a legal monopoly\n- E.g. Australia Post\n\nA technological advantage\n- E.g. Microsoft has considerable market power because it supplies the operating system used in most computers\n\nA patent on an invention gives protection from competition\n- Up to 17 years in Australia\n\n\n#### Imperfect Market Exploitation\n- Imperfect markets $\\rightarrow$ Firms use market power to 'exploit' the market.\n- A firm has market power if it can affect the market price by varying its output.\n- Firms with market power will try to maximise profit.\n- Private interest $\\rightarrow$ not necessarily align with society\n\n\n### Anti-Competitive Behaviour\n- Firms with market power $\\rightarrow$ incentive to reduce competition\n\t- Either reducing price competition or by reducing the number of firms competing in the market\n\n\n\u003e [!DEFINITION] Anti-Competitive Behaviour\n\u003e Refers to any agreements or arrangements between firms that seek to restrain competition and thereby remove the automatic regulation that competitive markets achieve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Externalities\n\n\u003e [!DEFINITION] Externalities\n\u003e The side effects of economic activity are referred to as externalities.\n\n\n### Negative Externalities\nExamples:\n- Smog from driving cars\n- Lawn mowers create noise pollution\n- Use of fossil fuels contribute to global warming\n\n\n\u003e [!DEFINITION] Negative Externalities\n\u003e When economic actions from either production or consumption create an external cost, it is referred to as a negative externality.\n\nPollution is a classic example of a negative externality.\n- A factory that emits pollutants into the atmosphere is likely to impose an external cost on those people who are affected by the pollutants\n- Firms pollute the environment as it is free (no one owns it)\n- If the firm was forced to install air filters to eliminate the pollutants, then there would be no external cost and there would be no market failure\n\n**Social cost is equal to private costs plus external cost**\n\n![[notes/IMAGE -

Common Property Resources\n- Refers to the over-consumption of common property resources\n- Occurs as the resource is readily available and there are no restrictions on consumption\n- However, once consumed the resource is not available to any other party.\n\n\n### Free Rider Effect - Public Goods\n- Free riders enjoy the benefits of the consumption of a resource without paying for the cost of provision\n- This can lead to over-consumption and rapid damage of a public resource\n\n\n### Policy Options to Address the Market Failure\n#### Common Property Goods\n- Enforce restrictions on consumption -

New equilibrium - Compare\n\n\n\n\n### One Way Shifts\n##### Decrease in demand:\n\u003e There is an increase in price of complementary goods causing a decrease in demand, shifting the demand curve to the left from D to D1. At the original price point, Quantity supplied, $Q_e$, exceeds Quantity demanded, $Q_2$. There is a temporary surplus from $Q_e$ to $Q_2$. Firms decrease the price to get rid of excess stock leading to a contraction along the supply curve, causing an expansion along the D curve. The temporary surplus is cleared and the new equilibrium point is at a lower price point, P3 and at a higher quantity, $Q_3$.\n\n### Two Way Shifts\n##### Decrease in supply, increase in demand:\n\u003e There is a non-price factor that is causing an increase in demand, shifting the demand curve to the right from $D$ to $D_1$ and a non-price factor causing a decrease in supply, shifting the supply curve to the left, from $S_1$ to $S_2$. At the original price point, quantity demanded, $Q_3$, exceeds quantity supplied, $Q_2$. There is a temporary shortage from $Q_2$ to $Q_3$. Consumers bid up the price leading to contraction along the demand curve, leading to an expansion along the supply curve. The temporary shortage is cleared and the new equilibrium point is at a higher price point, $P_2$, and at an indeterminate quantity, $Q_1$.\n\n##### Increase in supply, decrease in demand:\n\u003e There is new technology causing an increase in supply shifting the supply curve to the right from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and there is a decrease in disposable income causing a decrease in demand shifting the demand curve to the right from $D_1$ to $D_2$. At the original price point, quantity supplied, $Q_3$, exceeds quantity supplied, $Q_2$. There is a temporary surplus from $Q_2$ to $Q_3$. Firms decrease the price to get rid of excess stock leading to a contraction along the supply curve, causing an expansion the $D$ curve.

Proofs","content":"#### Introduction\n\n- Proofs demonstrate the absolute truth of a statement, and should aim to achieve three things\n\n      - Correctness\n\n      - Clarity\n\n      - Simplicity\n\n- In proving statements, we should know some basic algebraic representations\n\n\t - `Even numbers` -  *$2m$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$*\n\n     - `Odd numbers` - *$2m + 1$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$*\n\n     - `Divisible by `$a$ -  *$am$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$*\n\n     - `Perfect Square` - *There exists* $a^2$ *for some* $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n     - `Prime` - *There does not exist* $ab$ *for some* $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ *and* $a,b\u003e1$\n\n- There are different ways to prove a statement, these are discussed below\n\n\n\n\n#### Direct Proof\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Direct proofs are in response to conditional statements, for example\n\n      - `If it is raining, then the grass is wet`\n\n      - In the form `If P is true, then Q is true`\n\n      - This is mathematically represented $P \\implies Q$ (`P` implies `Q`)\n\n            - `P` is the hypothesis, and `Q` is the conclusion\n\n- Not all conditional statements are true.\n\n  \n\n##### The Proof\n\n- To give a **direct** proof of a statement $P \\implies Q$, we must assume the hypothesis (P) to be true and show the conclusion (Q)\n\n- **Example**\n\n      - `If a is odd and b is even, then a + b is odd`\n\n      - $let \\space a = 2n+1 \\space for \\space some \\space n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (we must include for some)\n\n      - $let \\space b=2m \\space for \\space some \\space b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (second definition)\n\n      - $a+b=2n+1+2m$\n\n      - $=2(n+m)+1$; this is in the odd form ([[#Introduction]]) - we must complete that however by stating $for \\space some \\space n+m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n      - $\\therefore Q.E.D$; from above it is obviously proved, but we should wrap it up - **Q.E.D essentially means** *it is proved, as you can obviously see*\n\n- There may be more complex examples\n\n      - These will require **factorisation** and algebraic manipulation, and expanded reasoning\n\n      - The logic stays the same though\n\n      - **Knights and Knaves** questions will almost always require the consideration of *all cases*\n\n  \n\n#### Proof by Contrapositive\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Sometimes it is difficult to prove $P \\implies Q$ through direct proof; consider\n\n      - `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd`  \n\n      - We can't assume `P` ($n^{2}+2n+1$) because it is difficult to define\n\n      - However we can use the contrapositive\n\n- **The contrapositive of** $P \\implies Q$ is $Q' \\implies P'$ (the **negated things in the opposite order**\n\n  \n\n###### Negation\n\n- Making something opposite is called **negation** - the negation of $1+1=2$ is $1+1 \\not = 2$\n\n      - We can, however, encounter more difficult negations.\n\n      - Consider `negation of (6 is divisible by 2 and 3)`\n\n      - We can use De morgan's laws for this\n\n            - `not (P and Q) is the same as (not P) or (not Q)`\n\n            - `not (P or Q) is the same as (not P) and (not Q)`\n\n      - Therefore the above becomes `6 is not divisible by 2 or 6 is not divisible by 3`\n\n  \n\n###### Using Negation for the Contrapositive\n\n- For the above, `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd`\n\n- **If the original P =\u003e Q is true, it's contrapositive will always be true, and vice versa**\n\n      - The above is therefore true and can be directly proved\n\n  \n\n##### Proof\n\n- Let us consider the above; `If ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is even then ` $n$ `is odd`\n\n      - First, we should negate both sides and flip them - writing the contrapositive\n\n      - This is `If ` $n$ `is even then ` $n^{2}+2n+1$ `is odd` in the form $P \\implies Q$\n\n      - $let \\space n = 2a \\space for \\space some \\space a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n      - $n^{2}+2n+1 = (2a)^{2}+2(2a)+1$\n\n      - $=4a^2+4a+1$; getting us into even number accounted form\n\n      - $=2(a^{2}+2a)+1$; it may seem like we are doing little but this puts us in the traditional odd form\n\n            - $for \\space some  \\space a^{2}+2a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n      - $\\therefore Q.E.D$\n\n  \n\n#### Equivalence Proofs\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- Equivalent Statements are given in the form $P \\iff Q$\n\n      - To prove equivalence though, we must first prove a statement **and** [[#The converse]]\n\n- In written form, $P \\iff Q$ is `P is true if and only if Q is true`, for example;\n\n      - `Your heart is beating if and only if you are alive` (this is an equivalent statement)\n\n- If a question includes `if and only if`, remember to consider both cases\n\n      - To indicate the case being proven, write $\\implies$ or $\\impliedby$\n\n  \n\n##### The converse\n\n- If a statement $P \\implies Q$ exists, then the converse is simply $Q \\implies P$\n\n      - i.e the contrapositive with less steps\n\n  \n\n#### Disproving of Statements\n\n##### Reasoning\n\n- In general, when **disproving** statements, we only need **one example**\n\n- There are, however, two types of statements you may have to disprove;\n\n      - **Universal Quantification** (also known as *for all*).\n\n            - `For all natural numbers n, 2n \u003e n + 1`\n\n            - The above statement can only be **proved** by providing an argument concerning all natural numbers *n*\n\n      - **Existential Quantification** (also known as *there exists*)\n\n            - `There exists an integer m such that m^2 = 25`\n\n            - Due to the nature of this statement, we only need one integer *m* to **prove** the statement\n\n      - Both of these statements involve quantifiers. In order to disprove, we should know [[#Negating Quantifiers]]\n\n  \n\n##### Negating Quantifiers\n\n- To negate quantifiers, we just swap 'there exists' and 'for all' and then *negate the rest of the statement*\n\n      - `For all natural numbers n, 2n \u003e n+1` $\\rightarrow$ `There exists natural number n such that 2n \u003c n + 1`\n\n      - And vice versa.\n\n  \n\n##### Disproving\n\n- **Universal Quantifications**\n\n      - Can be disproved via `counterexample` - this is because it asserts truth without exception.\n\n- **Existential Quantification**\n\n      - This is different - because this involves a *there exists* (truth with exceptions), we must prove that there does not exist at all\n\n\t\t- Due to this, we must prove **the negation to be true** ([[#Negating Quantifiers]])\n\n\n##### Proof by Induction\n\t- State the Proposition: P(n)\n\t- Try for P(1)\n\t- Assume P(k)\n\t- Try for P(k+1)\n\n\n$7^{k} - 4 = 3m$\n$7^{k+1}-4 = 7(7^{k}-4)+24$\n\t\t\t $= 7(3m)+24$\n\t\t\t $=3(7m+8)$\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-05T04:29:07.413154388Z","tags":null},"/notes/Journal-Computer-Science":{"title":"Journal - Computer Science","content":"\n### Term 2\n#### W1L1\nContinued work on our project that is due in on Wednesday\n\n#### W1L2\nMessed around as usual.
